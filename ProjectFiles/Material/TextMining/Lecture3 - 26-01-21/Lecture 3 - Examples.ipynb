She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.\\n</td>\n",

Factors to consider--long-standing problem, marital issues, recent delivery of twins 12/1978 -IVF/donor egg/breatfeeding, sexual abuse as a child age 7-?college, depressed mood (variable), hypothyroid (treated).  Pt. has almost no libido now and feels this may be impacting her marriage.  She can lubricate and get orgasm on occasion.  She has had some success with sexual fantasy in the past.  She has not followed through with a med trial of bupropion rx by Peggy Wiggins, MD because she was breast feeding at  the time.  Discussion of the complexity of the problem.  Advised she resume couple's therapy/indiv therapy or discuss with husband if he would be willing to come in for behaviorally-based sex therapy. Reading list given for her to explore options.  Med addition may be helpful to rx mood symptoms and libido (which may be low because of mood.)Patient Instructions\\n  \n",

The first of these episodes occurred when facial meshing was placed on him during radiation therapy. He recalled the experience vividly and described \"freaking out\", involving a sensation of crushing in his chest, difficulty breathing, a fear that he could die, and intense emotional disquiet. The second episode occurred during the last 10-15 minutes of an MRI scan. Mr. Echeverria noted feeling surprised and fearful when the feelings of panic started. Similar physiological and psychological symptoms were reported as above. The third episode occurred recently on 6/29/81. Mr.Echeverria was driving his car and felt similar symptoms as described above. He reported fearing that he would crash his vehicle and subsequently pulled over and abandoned his vehicle.\\n  \n",

Pt was seen in Lutheran Brethern Homes intake clinic.  Since her father's death, pt report worsening depression, poor sleep, fatigue, anxiety, and auditory hallucinations. Her auditory hallucinations consist of her father's voicing telling her to come with him, but she denies any commands to harm herself. Father died Oct 1986, mother died the year prior.  Sister died last year.  As a result of these voices patient's sleep has worsened. She denies suicidal ideation stating that she would never harm himself because of her youngest sons who live at home.\\n  \n",

She also purges by self-induced vomiting \"when I feel like I'm eating too much.\"  Typically this is after breakfast and dinner.  She reports that she has been vomiting 2x/day \"most days\" for the past 3 months, consistent with \"extreme\" to \"severe\" severity of compensatory behaviors per DSM-5.  She notes that she previously vomited 4-6x/day between ages 11-16 yo (i.e., before she received any treatment for her eating disorder).  She previously took laxatives 2x/day from ages 14-17, but the last episode was >1 year ago (stopped b/c \"they were wicked expensive\").  She has also taken diet pills (last episode in Feb 1993) but stopped b/c \"they weren't working.\"  No history of diuretic misuse.\\n  \n",

She denied ever attempting to take her life, but noted coming close to it in the past. Patient also reported that she has not had suicidal ideation, intent, or plan since 1997, other than this one instance this past week of passive ideation. Patient committed to the safety plan, which is to call 911, or call her sister if she is unable to call 911 (who would call 911 for her), or go to the nearest ER and then page the current writer. She also has the number for the crisis hotline and related that she could also call her mental health counselor that she sees at DMC.

She feels she has recovered from that mental health relapse and is healthier at this time, putting greater focus on her overall health and well being, having positive supports and being honest w them about her functioning, and feeling a strong connection w her psychiatrist.  While pt has made great strides in improving her mental health, supports, and activities, there is concern w her level of distress and attachment related to the current relationship and how problems within that relationship could be risk factors for her decline in functioning.

Patient primary concern is related to a TBI experienced at bootcamp in 01/2007. He reports a fellow army recruit sucker punched him from behind and knocked him out immediately. He is not sure how long he was out for but the next thing he remembers he was in the ambulance going to the hospital. He reports problems since that time although it was hard to get a sense of the specific symptoms he is experiencing. He reports he tends to wake up in the middle of the night and feels like he is having a seizure and can't control his body. He will feel disoriented at times (not completely dissociative, but feels \"weird, out of my body.\" He also had headaches and feels lightheaded. He reports he has also been struggling with depression since the incident where he will have good days and down days. On the down days, he wants to sleep all day and not get out of bed.\\n  \n",

In Jun 2007 she was assessed at ASMC for vertigo which is worsened by stress and then later in the year she was twice seen in the Ronan Medical Clinic ED for chest pain with apparently negative cardiac work-up.  She describes both persisting generalized anxiety (feeling on edge, restless, worried) as well as episodic-like autonomic arousal (sweating, dizziness, chest tightness, chills) consistent with panic attacks.

She says he has been successful in abstaining from substances as far as she knows, thinks a schedule is useful to him, doctor's appts etc.  Notes that he returned from LA in August 2008, gets bouts of \"exhaustion\" even in sobriety.

She shared that she has recently lost a great deal of weight and is having difficulty meeting her calorie needs due to difficulties with gagging/swallowing, and aversions to specific food textures.  Specifically, since May 2012, she has lost 18 lbs, going from 128 lbs (BMI = 19.5, normal range) to 110.2 lbs (BMI = 16.8, underweight range) at a height of 5'8\" tall.  She has had amenorrhea for 2 months.  Her current weight is her lowest since high school, when she was a model and weighed 98 lbs (BMI = 14.9, underweight range).  At that time, she had amenorrhea, felt pressure to be thin in order to keep her job, and most likely met criteria for frank anorexia nervosa nervosa-restricting type.\\n  \n",

She is seeking help mainly around management of anxiety, and it is unclear to what extent alcohol (which she has not consumed since May 2016) is affecting her current situation.  Biological factors include likely primary mood and/or anxiety disorders (perhaps depression with panic attacks), consequences of long-term alcohol use. Important psychological factors include the loss of three improtant family members and the prior trauma at multiple times. Her social situation reflects isolation and an unfortunately high level of dependence on her children.  One important challenge is her discomfort with opening up and seeking care, which may benefit from positive treatment alliances.\\n  \n",

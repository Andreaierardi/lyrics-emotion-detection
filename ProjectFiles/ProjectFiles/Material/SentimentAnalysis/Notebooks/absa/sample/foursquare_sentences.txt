The chicken wing is the best xD yums <3

Inside usually faster but not always.
The mushroom crostini is OUT of this world.
No joke - surpasses every other crostini we tried by a long shot.
Don't ask for a cup of water to go with your $10 purchase.
Apparently there's no time to help customers with 2 employees and 0 line, but plenty of time to worry about "rules" against "free cups"
Pitas are incredibly tasty but avoid the lentil soup at all costs.
They honor restaurant.com certificates everyday!

Gourmet Mexican food with nearly 300 tequilas to choose from, descriptions which can be easily accessed on the iPad menus, will be great to drink on the seaside deck (note: don't drop the menu).

I don't recommend buying Pico de Gallo fruit here.
It's expensive, 7 bucks for a large and they don't put all the fruit that the list says.

for take-away the service is rather slow
Go when it's real busy for fresh foods.
They ask for gratuity when you 1st pay, save it for the table to see how service is.
Slowest drive through ever.
Try Taqueria - L3 #03-29: Being intense foodies, we had the privilege to try the most unique Taco experience bar none.

The wait is worth it.
Food is awesome!
The Wait staff is cool and helpful.
Really good live music!

This place gives Hot Doug's a run for it's money.
If they had duck fat fries and a foie gras dog, I'd never go to Chicago again.
Use the door on the left!!!!
I had a meal where the staff from the senior manger to junior team took care of me.
Very satisfying customer service & good taste

It's ok!
Kashmir Restaurant on Penang Road reins supreme!
They have more tender and more fresh chicken!
Fresher and tastier dal!
Better biryani!
Fresher and softer naan - the naan here is cardboard
The mac and cheese isn't quite as good as at Mishkin's, but still a belter.

Salmon Bennie was quite good.
I come back often for the burger or skirt sandwich.
Great selection of juices and teas.
I try to try something new every time.
Hipster's paradise.
Try the Ethiopian Yirga.
Looking through the bag isn't enough.
Dump it out on your seat so you don't drive home without your chicken nuggets.
They will make good on the missing nuggets, but that's a half an hour wasted!

Bo Bo Chicken is amazing, also!
appetizer - wood-grilled octopus

Don't expect a line.
You have to fight your way to place your order
Horrible service.
Good thing I checked my order before I left.
feeling a little rich this morning
Great place for a reasonably priced steak dinner in Vegas, service is always impeccable.

Chicken curry is not good.
Buffalo Medium wings have nice kick and great flavor
Fantastic Italian bistro on the waterfront, delicious food, excellent service, beautiful view and a friendly staff!
Megna have now launched their new website www.megna-cs.com allowing everyone to now order takeaway online or even book a table.

New staff, not very generous with the toppings, and not very quick...
Hope you get the senior staff!
Get the biscuits & gravy.
Just do it.
Choco Banana crepe ($50) is to die for!
So much brownie and Nutella!
Take out also available.
Remember going there during the last football world cup.
Terribly rude manager.
Why so expensive?
Mid level food, ordinary place, nothing special.
Beat authentic taco truck on the Westside.
You can't go wrong with their al pastor tacos.
Top with their homemade cucumber/onion/jalapeÃ±o mixture for a fresh kick!
Don't forget to order creme brulee as a dessert
Love the chicken and dumplings!
From Hongik Univ station exit #9, walk straight till the you find VIPS steak.

Chicken riggies & garlic knots.
Excellent service here!
The Tokyo Fog with tapioca and soy was great!
Hey that's me!
Lobster bisque was excellent
The chai milkshakes are phenomenal!
Try the pljeskavica sandwich.
It's a monstrous cross between a gyro and a hamburger.
Spectacular.
Don't waste your time (or $$$) on the salads or sandwich.
Stick with the lobster roll and lobster mac & cheese and you won't be disappointed.
Watch out for overuse of tarragon though....shudder.
You gotta try the cheese cake!
Flores is the best.
can't tell the difference between the new homestyle fries as opposed to the old fries other than the new ones have a little bit of skin on them. still have to drown them in sauce to make them bearable
Bang bang shrimp is the best shrimp ever!
Best salmon sashimi in town.
The food is ok but the service here sucked.
I ordered a beer and our food came out but my beer never did.
After taking my order we never saw the waiter.
Best Dunkin' Donuts around!
We will always drive further to this one than the one by our home from now on, just because of the great service from a guy named ADAM that was awesome to us!!!!
Great food great service
Only Starbucks for many miles!
This is a new restaurant off of the square in Ellijay, GA.
The restaurant is actually located inside/behind TJ's antiques.
I stopped by here with my wife and kids and we loved the chicken salad!
The mushrooms are delicious!!!
For a healthy lunch get the grilled chickens salad with BBQ sauce, ranch and bread.
It's a really authentic Dim Sum Restaurant.
Good service + a nice boss that would explain the food to you whenever you have a question.
It's tiny inside but it's also all about quality + not quantity.
This place reminds me of home.
So thankful WJ's is here.
LOVE THE MINI!! ....come to gahanna :D
If they are busy and say "seat yourself", make sure they see where you sit or you could wait a while.
Get the Cortado.
The most perfect amount of milk and espresso with a heart on top.
Food is wonderful, but the service can be much better.
They seem to be preoccupied with something and tend to "miss" eye contact.
Adult milkshakes are worth the calories.
But highly variable.
Very nice and quite place ;)
Don't let the name fool ya, they've got kickin catfish and fried pickles too, not many are aware of this tidbit.
So many foods here.!!
Got shisha, chicken wing, thailand, western and etc ..
Come and chill at PakNgah CAFE (",)
Their Chocolate Chip tastes awesome.
The garlic fries are awesome!!
Really good BBQ: brisket, ribs, pulled pork, chicken, fried chicken, sausage

Think of Astaria as the Buck's of San Mateo.
It's the place to meet if you're part of the Metro San Mateo tech entreprenuerial community!
Must try the crispy duck!
Sweet potato and sage dumplings are the stuff of dreams.
The staff is amazing, and it's a must to have a Sexy girl!! ;) don't leave without her :p

Peanut butermoo'd!
Great place for a meeting.
Sit by the warm fire.
Live Music Every Saturday Night 10-1am!!
The tiramisu is fantastic.
They give you the cake, coffee, creme, powder and you build it yourself.
Delicious.
What isn't good here?
My favorite has to be the four veg plate - pintos, fried okra, carrots, and apples...with cornbread of course!
The management is the worst i've ever had to deal with.
They take 0 responsibility.
Treat their nonfavorite employees like total garbage even when they do their job above the "favorites".
YUM!!!!! this pizza is delicious!!!
They use moldy bread becareful my sandwich had mold on it nasty
Great food and cheap, awesome atmosphere
Everything on the menu is heaven on your taste buds!
I crave their food!

Good food, service was extremely accommodating, they get an A+ for that!
Fort Wayne's best micro-brew.
Grab a booth along the windows & watch traffic as you sip a flight of their beers and munch on a Politician pizza, or Jambalaya Flatbread, a personal favorite of mine.
This place is awesome.
Has everything you could want for Mexican cuisine.
Great place before and after work.
Nice ambiance! :smiling_face:ï¸
Vegetable pad Thai is the best!
Along with the Sapota drink...YUM

Crab stuffed artichoke hearts.
Delish!

Dj eetu kafamiza saaptin!!

Probably the best Starbucks in this state
We get promotion buy 2 get 1 free on sandwich.
We also get birthday complementary dessert. the sandwich club & green tea is nice, raspberry smoothies is delish and blueberry cheese cake is a must try
Definitely not speedy at night.
So, be ready to practice your patience.
The crab rice is not very tasty.
Just basically rice n crab.however, the clams wi thai lemon sauce is great.
The grape prawns are not too bad but I think they are not fresh enough.
Best salsa everrr, on good days though lol
$8.90 lunch deal comes with soup and a drink
Nice cup of tea Fab-u-lous ;-)
You won't find a better breakfast biscuit anywhere.
We detour just for the country fried steak biscuits.

Chicken wings are awesome!!!
The service is very bad, stuff is rude and impolite, very high gratuity!!!??
Try the pork ribs :)
Burger was cooked to PERFECTION.
I order rare, and a lot of places mess it up.
They did get it right.
Soft and tender, but still with that just grilled taste.
And the homemade knish is incredible!
Really good sushi.
I don't normally like big burgers and it's not a cheap burger, but this is truly one of the best burgers I've had.
It's quite messy to eat but extremely delicious.
Go with the plate instead of the sandwich to get delicious vinegary potatoes with your meal
Their chai latte is heavenly.
Very disappointed with the quality of ingredients and the portions, pricy food with no exceptional service.
Order took too long though the place wasn't crowded, overall, it's an experience I regret
Horrible parking during rush hour.
Actually at any hour.
The one at torrance crossroads is much better
0.50mbps downspeed (usually)
Cosy and elegant .
Value for money.
Porter is a cool guy to hang with.
Sit at the bar- he'll set you up right.
Chocolate chip pancakes were extremely luxurious, i'd like to have seen some more chocolate but maybe I'm greedy.Omelette was fluffy & very tasty.
Hash browns were crispy outside creamy inside 10/10
Classic Indianapolis donuts, hard to beat them all the way across the board, though I do love Harts
Super great tuna & cucumber panini.
I like how tune is not hot while the panini is hot

Hands down one of my favorite restaurants.
Plates are to be shared.
BBQ (smoked beef and slow roasted pork) is amazing and order several sides such as the yuca, fried plantains, and cornbread
Neighbour with The Little Prince Creamery :-)
Went here specifically for cheese omelette after reading so many 4sq reviews which was light & good.
It was one of the places to visit on my list & I wasn't disappointed.
Usual waiting time 30-45 min
All the old diner standards.
And this is one of the best around.
A favourite place for a quick nibble
Great neighborhood place that supports Teller Elementary!
Try the dark mocha iced coffee.
Its awesome.

That's it!
Forget about the rest in the menu *yawn*
Come here for the chicken shwarma.
I asked noodles with shrimps and...
Were a lot of noodles and just 5 little shrimps :/ Went out completely hungry.
Good food, drinks, entertainment, & prices!!!

positive;"When I had problems with the return of the bike, the assistance was very kind, but could not solve the problem quickly nor prevent me from being charged for the rental because I had exceeded half an hour (not because of the route I took carried out, but due to the impossibility of hanging up the bike in 2 different stations). It would be desirable to be able to solve problems more efficiently or at least not to charge the user in the event of a reported malfunction. For the rest, when the service works, it's really practical and useful.	"
positive;"more electric bikes. often even if present they are not available when there are few, why?	"
negative;"pay more attention to stations that very often are without bicycles or full and do not allow their repositioning	"
positive;"essential to insert bikes with child seats	"
positive;"extension completed at train and metro stations not yet served	"
positive;"I would like the number of bikeMi stations to be strengthened even in other areas of the city	"
positive;"Good service ... stations could be increased	"
negative;"Some bikes are too heavy, some have defects in pedaling	"
positive;"Often the piazza castebarco station is not functioning	"
positive;"more bikes in the center starting at 20.00	"
positive;"satisfied	"
positive;"it would be nice to be able to choose the bike - the bikes require more maintenance (brakes, bell and gearbox)	"
positive;"Check that the saddles are better fitted, they are often badly fitted and uncomfortable, thanks.	"
positive;"increased maintenance of the vehicles	"
negative;"the bike is ugly	"
negative;"The rush hour is a dosastes. No bikes are available and when you find them x go to the center x example no they are available place x hang up	"
negative;"The service is useful, convenient, ecological, practical. The distribution of the stations is discreet. However the maintenance of the bikes leaves much to be desired as 3/5 times the bikes present inefficiencies in the use: broken saddle, deflated tires, not working lights (in the dark it is dangerous), electric bicycles often not working, broken mudguards that prevent correct use, broken or crooked wheels, etc ... these are the cases reported by the undersigned.	"
positive;"My life has changed since I have the station near home. It would be useful to have even more stations even in more peripheral areas, so that the service can be used for any movement	"
positive;"very comfortable, poor bikes, customer service available	"
positive;"The service is comfortable but you should do more maintenance and increase the electric bikes	"
positive;"Good service	"
negative;"All very nice but postponed the closing time of the service, the reason why it is suspended at 1.00 am is incomprehensible.	"
negative;"Too often damaged or not perfect bikes	"
negative;"missing rear-view mirror. INDISPENSABLE	"
positive;"often yellow bikes require maintenance.	"
positive;"apart from the fact that there are often bikes that are not adequately maintained and the lack of bikes in some locations, for the rest I would say that it is an excellent service	"
positive;"would be bellom if you extended the bikemi stations also to the immediate periphery (gambara area for example) and if the bicycles were a little lighter. Furthermore, in the city center at 9 am during the week the stations are almost always full. the service is still very useful!	"
positive;"Excellent idea. Only a few stalls near schools and in the Lomellina area are missing	"
positive;"#NAME?	"
positive;"It's a good setivice	"
negative;"the difficulty of parking at some stations has increased considerably. Provide more stays in the busiest stations	"
negative;"Lack of suburban stations (for example Barona and Piazza Negrelli) and at strategic points near the metro, even where there would be space, for example it is incredible that there is a station in Piazza Gerusalemme!	"
negative;"Unfortunately, in the last year the service has deteriorated. Inefficient stalls, broken or malfunctioning bikes. The new yellow bikes have a seat that looks like a comfortable aircraft carrier but suffers the overall attitude of the person that makes the bikes tougher.	"
positive;"very useful but definitely in need of improvement	"
positive;"I am generally very happy. The stations near the university (Cattolica, Bocconi) are unfortunately often full. It would absolutely need more bike paths especially in the south of the cathedral (Duomo - Bocconi connection).	"
positive;"The suggestion would be to be able to take the bikes at any time, in my case the ideal would be from 5:00 onwards, but I believe that other people who depend on public transport would like it, because the metro starts at 6:00 and in certain places you do not go with the tran, at least you do not arrive with them	"
positive;"Not knowing the streets of Milan, I often get lost. Would it be convenient a smartphone holder so I can easily let myself be guided by google maps, or a navigator system integrated to the bicycle handlebar?	"
positive;"Everything is fine, I invite you to evaluate the station crossing Corso Venezia / Via Senato, a point of great traffic, the nearby stations are relatively distant	"
negative;"bad civic-road car and motorcycle education	"
positive;"I am satisfied with the service, I would like there to be a closer monitoring of the presence of both bicycles and free places in the stations, I happened to have to turn 5 stations to leave the bicycle	"
positive;"I am satisfied globally	"
positive;"I find the service quite satisfactory and well set up, as a bike user in Turin for 10 years, I find it difficult to ride a bike in Milan due to the different urban layout of the roads and the more aggressive car traffic. New infrastructures and cycle paths are absolutely necessary, in the wake of cities like Berlin or London.	"
positive;"Very good service. I recommend more maintenance on yellow bikes. Comments: heavy bikes for a woman.	"
negative;"Unfortunately I just missed a train because there were no free bays in Cadorna	"
positive;"Many of the bikes are often heavily damaged by customers of the service due to misuse. It should be possible to check that everyone always makes the best use of the bicycles provided.	"
positive;"Keep the stations open until 2 am	"
negative;"improve the management of broken and unusable bikes	"
positive;"Many times in the morning bikes are not available	"
positive;"more attention to bike maintenance	"
negative;"In the city center at certain times it is difficult to find a place to leave the bike	"
positive;"Overall satisfactory service, useful implementations of stations and parking places, very useful notice of stations not in service i with sms or with luminous columns visible from a distance and immediate possibility of displaying an alternative station directly from the display on the station column	"
positive;"Possibility of use even at night	"
positive;"I want bikes that are light and manageable that drive you with pleasure. These are a pain!	"
positive;"Check the status of the bikes more (eg saddle wheel brakes) and add stations in the areas where they have been removed due to m4 work	"
positive;"More effective cleaning and maintenance program. Possibility to report directly, if the bike has presented operating anomalies.	"
positive;"Special rates for seasonal use.	"
positive;"I have already mentioned the problem to an operator, when the stations are replenished you should leave some free space so that those who took the bike before refueling on the return will have the place to leave it	"
positive;"Okay so, thanks	"
negative;"Great service, but I often have to change the yellow bikes because they work badly	"
negative;"The service is convenient and useful, the stations are frequent but the service should be extended more to the periphery. The bikes are a bit heavy, in particular the latest provisions are too high and the saddle is difficult to adjust	"
negative;"Yellow bikes aren't that great. The app needs to be improved.	"
positive;"Great	"
positive;"I lived in Munich ...	"
negative;"They are too heavy bicycles and often have low maintenance tires and aluminum tires	"
negative;"The service is very nice but the bicycles do not always work (both yellow and red), often taking penalty points that would be attributed not to the user but to the malfunction of your systems	"
positive;"I often preferred to take the bus because the first useful station is 10 minutes from home. I live in Via Lomellina, it would be useful to have a station in Viale Corsica or a class port.	"
negative;"I have already had problems with delivery where the bikes do not appear to have been delivered. Often the toy moves and the nibs work	"
positive;"More cycle paths are needed for safe circulation	"
positive;"Electric bikes to improve drastically. Non-electric bikes: weak change!	"
positive;"I'm excited about it and I think it was a big step forward for Milan	"
positive;"it would take more stations	"
positive;"Do not fill all the positions when doing the tricarica because I could not return my in use	"
positive;"Excellent and fast. Competitive prices. Easy to find. Not always compliant, but still available.	"
positive;"I would like to point out that the change does not work for many bikes	"
positive;"enthusiastic for civic pride, has increased the number of cyclists in the city and therefore also the safety of all (safety by numbers)	"
negative;"I often find no place to leave the bike in the desired location	"
positive;"Great service, yellow bicycles often have problems, some stations would also be needed in the suburbs	"
positive;"use even at night was very convenient	"
positive;"Very valid service. Increase stalls even in the suburbs. More maintenance.	"
negative;"I would like bikes to be serviced more often: I often find them with saddles that dangle, brakes that work badly etc	"
positive;"satisfied	"
positive;"positive	"
positive;"Only points to improve: (1) the possibility to signal when the bikes do not work in order to have more fully functioning bikes and (2) the bikes without time limits, at least on weekends	"
negative;"Many yellow bikes have mechanical problems. In the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãPallavicino / Nievo / Rossetti the bikemi parking has not been announced	"
negative;"some hardware / software problems, especially when delivered	"
positive;"I would like more coverage of the service (coverage in Viale Monza, at least near Parco Trotter)	"
positive;"FANTASTIC EXCEPT FOR STATIONARY CROWDING	"
positive;"The application has to be improved a lot	"
positive;"Increased maintenance abilities and stalls	"
positive;"revision of e-bike batteries	"
positive;"Overall, everything is fine and for this reason I have been renewing my subscription constantly for 4-5 years. Honestly, it would be a great pleasure to always find bicycles with well-inflated wheels and a functioning gearbox.	"
positive;"improve bicycle maintenance and evolve towards lighter bicycles	"
positive;"Information on waiting for resumption of service when the station is empty or out of service would be welcome	"
positive;"I advise you to improve the maintenance of the brakes and the setting of the march of the bikes, often malfunctioning, the rest is ok and I am happy	"
negative;"The new bikes do not look good because when they are stuck they don't see the small light. The old ones are much better. The news are too heavy!	"
negative;"many are broken	"
positive;"More attention to maintenance	"
negative;"Missing a lock to close the bike if you want to leave the bike furiously from the parking lot without returning it.	"
positive;"The yellow bikes don't work properly most of the times. The free use of the bike should be 1 hour, not 30 minutes. The service should be available 24h / 7, during the night, Bikemi could be an alternative way to get home after the public transports are not running.	"
positive;"Absolutely to improve the redistribution of bicycles in the busiest stations during peak hours. Often there are no bikes available or the stalls are full	"
positive;"e-bike too often not working	"
positive;"Definitely satisfied and grateful	"
positive;"good	"
positive;"you are friendly and helpful	"
positive;"Great service very well done. Only bike conditions need to be improved. Principalmebte swollen wheels	"
positive;"favorable	"
positive;"A really useful service, I hope in the possibility of using 24 hours a day, especially for us young people it can be very useful at night when the vehicles are almost zero and you are forced to use taxis.	"
positive;"Improve the service of electric bicycles, too often discharged.	"
positive;"Extend the timetable 24 hours a day	"
negative;"Improve bike maintenance and simplify the communication of their failures	"
positive;"increase bike lanes, increase bike rental hours, improve electric bikes and check yellow bike status more frequently	"
positive;"The service is very good and has improved a lot since the beginning. It can still be improved by increasing the maximum time beyond which the travel expenses are no longer covered by the season ticket (for example from half an hour to three quarters of an hour), and checking the status of the bicycles more often (it happens too often to find bikes with the third and / or second gear broken and be forced to go very slowly!).	"
positive;"improve maintenance	"
negative;"The stalls located in the center are ALWAYS full and it is difficult to find a post where to deliver the bike	"
positive;"Very good in general ... if I have to find improved points, I would say first of all that bicycles are heavy and hardly manageable and the bicycle filling / checking system is not the most effective	"
negative;"intensify maintenance! Often the bikes picked up have gearbox problems, pedals, saddle	"
negative;"It happened to me several times that the electric bikes were empty and therefore much heavier than the classic ones. Furthermore, there is no possibility to conveniently report any faults (such as text messages and apps).	"
negative;"Not always adequate state of efficiency of the vehicles. Yellow bikes with mechanical failures and red bikes with low battery.	"
positive;"Great service, convenient and environmentally friendly. It could be extended and be more widespread.	"
positive;"On average satisfied	"
negative;"Yellow bikes often have gearbox problems	"
positive;"I would like a bike-mi station near Piazzale Martini.	"
positive;"positive	"
negative;"Bikes are often in a bad state	"
positive;"To encourage families to use the service it would be essential to include a child seat	"
negative;"The system must signal the defective bicycles and lock them up to repair	"
positive;"okay cosi.sugg: some station in more external ring 90/91	"
positive;"Improve bike maintenance	"
positive;"We would need a flat pass to keep the bike for a longer period	"
positive;"Improve maintenance and availability in the most critical time slots	"
positive;"Extended service hours possible (24/7), extension of stalls in the perimeter area	"
negative;"Night time extension. Possibility to report damage	"
positive;"Overall positive experience, the only flaw bikes often in poor condition (brakes, gearbox, electric motor not working)	"
positive;"Inflate the tires !!!!!	"
positive;"I really appreciate the service, the stations are numerous, well located and it is rare to find them full or without bikes. But often (yellow) bicycles have gearbox problems, they are very heavy and much slower than normal bikes. For these reasons, moving on a bicycle every day I prefer my personal use of bikemi only in emergency situations. That said, I will continue to remain a subscriber for the moment because it is a winning idea and overall good service	"
positive;"I find it a useful and practical service	"
positive;"Positive but limiting having the nearest station 2km from home. It would be ideal to have a station near every exit from the metro.	"
positive;"I am happy to live in a city - very similar to those in Europe, but we must increase and encourage the use of the service and allow additional discounts in other services to make bikemi enjoyable. We need more spacious stations, as I am unable to get on my bike in the morning. We would use music to apply on bikes	"
negative;"There are some stations that are too full in the morning, with no free stalls to leave the bikes. Following reports it would be advisable to take this into consideration and not fill all the stalls during the night	"
positive;"More careful maintenance	"
positive;"it would be nice to have more bikemi stations in the suburbs	"
positive;"I like bikemi. Much could be improved. Most frequent bike repair. Proper distribution of the bikes also in the central areas. Unlimited night time	"
negative;"close Milan to cars, as Oslo will do, we are not ready, but sooner or later we have to start	"
positive;"EXCELLENT BUT I EXTEND THE TIME LIMIT FOR RETURN TO 10 HOURS FROM LEVEL	"
positive;"arrange the bikes, increase the number of stations, DO NIGHT SERVICE OTHERWISE NEED NOTHING AND PEOPLE GET FIRST TO TAKE YOUR BIKE	"
negative;"Serve a map of the stations. Often it turns empty in search of the nearest one, without finding it	"
positive;"Do maintenance	"
positive;"add bikemi stations both inside and, especially towards the outskirts of Milan. I found myself too many times in the hospital area looking for a space for the bike.	"
positive;"Positive experience, but bike maintenance should be more accurate	"
negative;"Inventing a way to report damage to bicycles and not make it more available to avoid the next user a nasty surprise. Some users ""turn"" the saddle as a signal.	"
positive;"Using the train and in correspondence of the station it happens to not find the bicycles or the free stalls.	"
positive;"There is a need for more stations, especially to some suburbs, in order to allow the use of bike sharing more uniformly.	"
positive;"The service is good, but closes too early. In this way it is not a valid alternative to the car to move in the evening	"
positive;"I like bikemi. service to be continuously improved (for coverage, bike operation, etc.) as already done but very valid	"
positive;"bicycles are quite heavy, if you don't have enough balance and like me you weigh less than 50 kg the use can be complicated	"
positive;"INCREASE THE STATIONS IN THE OUTSKIRTS	"
positive;"Make a statistic on the stalls used daily by users and absolutely avoid that the latter arrive at a stall, do not find a parking space and have to fall back on another bike station much further away from the desired location. This is an aspect to be improved, very important, it is a deterrent from the use of this service.	"
positive;"I would say good: I play sports while I move to work in the city	"
positive;"It would be nice to bring the time allowance to 45 minutes and have the family card	"
positive;"improve the bikes in maintenance and allow a simple and optional customer satisfaction survey at the end of the use	"
positive;"A flaw is the hook, you have to lift and often fix the two hooks that fold. In Paris and Berlin the connection is easier because the bike is not lifted	"
positive;"Please do not fill the stations at 22/23 every evening, otherwise it is impossible to store the bicycles in use after dinner. Thank you very much, you are excellent.	"
positive;"Frankly I have used it, little but I would like to do it more. I have never had any problems with it, nor with the way it is used, so I would say all is well. Perhaps the biggest problem is always finding spaces available at certain times of the day at the parking lots.	"
positive;"Absolutely happy with the time of the service which should start earlier in the morning	"
positive;"I am satisfied with the service and use it regularly. A few suggestions: often the stations are full of bikes when you come back from your lunch break to hang up, especially in the center. If possible it could be enlarged. Electric bikes often do not work and pedaling is very hard and therefore a heavy bike to move. The maintenance of yellow bikes has improved over time but it is still difficult to find a perfect bike, there is always some problems especially with the gearbox and pedals, but sometimes also with the saddle and brakes. Thanks anyway for the service, it changed my life for the better :-)	"
negative;"Do more maintenance and pay attention to recharging electric bikes	"
positive;"I find that outside of the service that in itself is wonderful, certain problems need to be resolved such as the displacement of the neuralgic areas of Saturday (Sempione and Navigli) and the session that ultimately I always find broken in the bikes.	"
positive;"The only major flaw of bikemi is that it doesn't work at night. It is the time when it can be most useful (less buses pass, there is less traffic, etc.). Many friends don't subscribe to bikemi for this reason, you lose a lot of potential customers ... In addition, I would broaden the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe stations (there are areas of Milan discovered).	"
positive;"Extend bike parking beyond the current areas where there are public parks in the city (eg lambro park)	"
negative;"The Service loses efficiency and credibility due to the unavailability of stalls in the center in the morning after 8.45am. More and more frequently not finding free stalls after turning even up to 10 stations I see myself forced to leave the bike at the station tying it with the supplied chain. I hope, among other things, that the Piazza Beccaria stations will soon be reactivated, broad august and upgraded	"
negative;"sometimes I found myself renting an electric car and it had dead batteries, when they are empty the column should not rent them out	"
positive;"Overall this is a great service	"
positive;"Very useful would improve the maintenance status of the yellow bicycles (it would be useful to be able to report breakdowns) is a management of the repositioning of the bikes in the most frequent parking areas during peak hours.	"
negative;"the only note that I consider a duty to do as a user, concerns the return of the bike. Too many times I have had to go around the blocks to find a vacant place without success, losing much more time than I would have spent on foot. (I also find it just right that I have been given a penalty, due to what I see as a disservice). I hope you find a way to solve this problem. For the rest, I am a satisfied customer.	"
negative;"Bicycle unloading service in the central Milan stations is not always efficient! Especially in the time bands from 9.30 to 12.30	"
positive;"Improve maintenance and service will be perfect	"
positive;"Optimal experience, very well located stations. Perhaps a little heavy for a woman to take / reinsert into supports.	"
positive;"the service should be adjusted and perfected	"
positive;"Cover the Calvairate area	"
negative;"the bicycles are the manager and the stalls are not adequate	"
negative;"Central parking lots are often occupied and leaving the bike is a problem	"
positive;"GREATER BICYCLE MAINTENANCE	"
positive;"Bicycles often do not have functioning changes	"
positive;"absolutely negative is the availability of bikes in certain and certain stands in certain time slots	"
negative;"I do not agree with the closing time for me there should not be so as to be a viable alternative when there are no means	"
positive;"satisfied	"
negative;"I do not like that yellow bikes are becoming like red ones in terms of basket and big saddle, which is uncomfortable for those who don't have big asses. In Garibaldi station around 19 20 the stall is always full and you have to queue to leave the bike. A stall near the Lambrate station is missing	"
positive;"In the case of occupied stalls, provide an alternative without a charge for returning the bike	"
positive;"Put nearby stations back to where you removed them to make way for the construction sites. And expand the bike sharing network	"
negative;"New traditional bikes are very uncomfortable	"
positive;"Now old bikes	"
positive;"Increase the stations	"
positive;"improve the monitoring of the stalls in the stations because often there are no free ones.	"
negative;"it would be better to check more the status of electric bikes, too often faulty and without thrust, discharged or with broken or unstable saddle	"
positive;"I would like the boundaries of use of the service to be extended also to the periphery.	"
positive;"I am often out of order (dancer saddle	"
positive;"On the whole, apart from the heaviness of the means to take it and hang it up, a roof and a more assiduous maintenance of the means would be appreciated.	"
positive;"Lighter bicycles and better gear	"
negative;"Add stations in suburban workplaces shift critical bike hours, bike-style status evaluation to report faults	"
negative;"Everything is fine except the lack of change on the e-bike	"
negative;"I find the experience very interesting, which makes Milan very civil. Unfortunately, lately it has happened to me quite often that bicycle breakdowns made me lose a lot of time.	"
positive;"Increase the number of retreat areas at schools with super low student fees. Increase withdrawal stations in less central areas - door to victory and via Molise. Improve the quality of the bicycle or the maintenance (many are broken). Associate museum cards with bike me cards	"
negative;"Around 11 pm it would be useful for a collaborator to check that there are bike stations to be able to leave especially in winter. In fact it often happens that there are no free positions	"
positive;"It would serve a station at the San Siro stadium	"
positive;"More maintenance for yellow bicycles	"
positive;"Good initiative but many bikes have breakdowns or make noises while pedaling. Sometimes the card reader does not work (especially in Cordusio) and I often find it hard to find one when I need it after work. I would like to use it regularly but if the service remains unreliable it will not renew the subscription	"
negative;"There should be the possibility to report a bike that does not work in this way it would not be used by the next user as it could also be dangerous!	"
negative;"Too heavy and inconvenient Electric ones too rare and often empty	"
positive;"Maintenance to change bikes very urgently !!!	"
positive;"the problem is that during peak hours the downtown stations are often full and you need to turn to be able to leave the bike down. often around a quarter of an hour / 20 min to find a free station.	"
positive;"positive, go ahead!	"
positive;"The app could be improved: the withdrawal map should be the default setting	"
negative;"they serve more cycle lanes, Milan and dangerous for bicycles	"
positive;"They should also be placed in the Primaticcio area	"
negative;"The only flaw of the service is the winter time which does not allow use after 24 hours	"
negative;"I wanted to use the service more, but often the paving in the center of Milan does not make it easy to use	"
negative;"Parking in the central stations in the early morning has become particularly problematic, causing considerable inconvenience (delays, charges, reports, etc.).	"
positive;"Positive	"
negative;"All very well. Some areas for improvement: the weight of red or orange but red ones is excessive and lifting them to stall them is a challenge. This type of bike then has a saddle that can be raised a little and often does not stop well and slips down so you have to ride at Fantozzi, in the center I often notice that when the stations are filled with bikes, many people arrive to leave the bike down and they have to wait: why don't you always leave two empty stalls instead of filling the whole station? Under my house in Piazza VI Febbraio the gravel as a ground for the station is not comfortable, it was not a good solution, in pagan way having made the paved cycle path was the ridge! Who is the genius? We dance to death, it will be even more beautiful but it makes no sense to have a smooth pavement and a cobblestone track!	"
positive;"A very useful service to live better keeping fit and respecting the environment and your city. It would be even more used if there were more bike lanes.	"
positive;"It would be ideal to have a bike with a lighter frame and saddles that are not too wide and of soft consistency. I would also like bikemi stations also in places like Via Mecenate and Viale Corsica	"
positive;"I am satisfied with the service and the only thing that can be improved is the quality of the bikes, which is more than satisfactory	"
negative;"you move quickly at low cost and without polluting	"
negative;"We should do much more maintenance on the bikes !! On the yellow ones the change is almost always broken now!	"
positive;"fantastic service but in milan many cycle paths end suddenly making the journey dangerous. pav√© and rails are also dangerous. the bikes are really too heavy and for those who are not very high road stability is at risk. comunwue congratulations for the service. it would also be useful if at the time of the renewal the current amount was immediately discounted for those who have the annual ATM subscription.	"
negative;"Cardan bike often not ok	"
positive;"It would be nice that even in winter the service was guaranteed up to, for example, three in the morning	"
negative;"often the edison and the cordusio patronage are empty in the evening	"
positive;"Lighter bikes and more effective parking management	"
positive;"Improve maintenance	"
negative;"red bicycles are not always charged and the cost charged in any case	"
positive;"put the best saddles on the yellow bike !! Increased availability of red bikes.	"
positive;"Urge maintenance on bikes	"
negative;"I FIND A LOT OF BAD NEW YELLOW BIKE	"
positive;"Great	"
negative;"The main problem detected is the availability of stalls in the most frequented areas	"
negative;"I almost always find bikes with defects (punctured wheels, broken brakes, broken saddles, strange chain noises, etc.)	"
negative;"customized bikes that only one individual uses for a defined period (hygienic problem)	"
negative;"I feel good sometimes the bikes are a bit damaged, you ride badly	"
negative;"Often the anti-theft padlock does not work and prevents leaving the bike outside a shop. Brakes are often poor.	"
negative;"In the past it has often happened that the columns for the rental did not work, it is necessary to avoid that whoever hangs up the bikes formi.la row to the column to verify end rental. I would consider alternative materials to make the bikes less heavy. I find it very inconvenient to hang up the bike with advertising banner in the basket is missing the visibility of the hooks	"
positive;"Opening at 7 is too late! At least 6.30	"
negative;"Useful service, however (yellow) bikes are often in a bad state. I often found inefficient brakes, and the pedaling proceeded in spurts (I suppose for the inadequate conditions of the CHANGE-CHANGE)	"
negative;"Two complaints: 1. Too often, the change works badly. 2. There are still too many uncovered areas! 3. Why doesn't the night work?	"
positive;"Increase bikemi stations	"
positive;"extend the service more to the periphery, otherwise I find it a great service	"
negative;"at the central station the pacheggs are sometimes either empty or full	"
positive;"HAPPY TO USE IT BUT OFTEN PEDALS, BETWEEN	"
negative;"it must be easy to report broken bikes. today it is impossible to call	"
positive;"Excellent. Congratulations	"
positive;"do more maintenance	"
negative;"Would it be possible to send a bike number with problems via SMS? Type brake pads, etc.	"
positive;"It would be necessary for the service to be continuous 24 hours a day	"
negative;"Not good	"
positive;"Generally well maintained bikes, unfortunately the model is heavy and not very agile. The center is very well connected, it would be useful to continue to integrate with more peripheral stations. My dream on a very beaten path: affori center -> first aid of niguarda, from which also passes the bike path .... :)	"
positive;"Great experience but I would increase the number of pick-up stations in the center and in the Fiera area	"
negative;"bikes should be maintained much, much better, often with badly maintained bicycles and without brakes or even for the electrics that the battery does not work	"
positive;"It's a servbizo that works very well and is very useful because it reduces traffic	"
negative;"in the morning I find the bike but repositioning it is becoming difficult and boring. I often can't find a place, all the stalls are full. Even risk of not being more punctual	"
negative;"Solve the problem of full and empty stations	"
negative;"yellow bikes that don't work I always pay for electricity	"
positive;"The service is good, very widespread, but the vehicles need more and more frequent maintenance	"
positive;"the suggestion I can give is to continue with the extension of the service	"
positive;"The changes of the yellow bikes are often not working, the 3rd gear does not go. Apart from that I am very satisfied.	"
positive;"It is a good service if taken as a whole, the suggestion I can give is to extend the number of stations to the peripheral areas (beyond the circular).	"
positive;"Improve the already good level of maintenance of the bikes - greater guarantee of functioning of the electrics	"
positive;"The service is great, I really appreciate it. However, bicycles are very heavy and not always in perfect condition. It would also be useful a special app where you can report in a click the ""stolen"" bikes outside the station that you sometimes see in the corners of the city	"
positive;"Good	"
negative;"Positive experience, shame about some missing stations in the Loreto area (via Padova and Viale Monza absent)	"
positive;"I would think of a handle to facilitate the delivery of the without getting dirty and without making too much physical effort (even if it is not my case)	"
negative;"only problem to report too often the stalls do not record the correct establishment of the bike and you risk icorrerere nela penalty	"
positive;"Increase number of electric bikes	"
positive;"Set up stations even in the most peripheral areas	"
negative;"There are too many bikes with problems	"
negative;"Interesting and pleasant, too bad a lot of badly functioning bikes	"
negative;"There are still too few stations in the city center to leave or pick up the bike	"
negative;"Lately I've found a lot of bad bikes	"
positive;"improve bicycle maintenance and bicycle redistribution service	"
positive;"I wish there were stations even in the suburbs. In the neighborhood you entrust there is not even one!	"
positive;"Definitely improve the model. Distribute the stations better on the territory, especially in the Via Ceresio area where there is no station.	"
positive;"Good morning, it would be nice to communicate some aspects of the operation of the pedal assisted bicycle, it is not written anywhere that the red light indicates that the bike has no energy, a small sticker would be enough in correspondence of the light with the writing ""red = bike unloaded""	"
positive;"One of the things I would change is the time of the service, in my opinion it should always be available	"
positive;"Very efficient service. The only flaw is that it cannot be used at any time of the night.	"
negative;"Too often there are no bikes available in downtown parking lots, especially in the evening	"
positive;"better use of apps to find bikes near me	"
positive;"Excellent initiative, too often the yellow bikes have a defect	"
positive;"Greater care of the maintenance of bicycles and the possibility through a signaling app of small inconveniences found on a bicycle	"
positive;"I welcome the service which clashes with the lack of cycle paths / tracks that would allow safer journeys and greater distances. The bikes are on average in good condition, I have sometimes found an incorrect distribution of the bikes in the different stations. For fault reports, a more immediate way should be found to let you know about failures or inconveniences to facilitate your maintenance activity. However, I consider a very appreciable service, the ideal would be to upgrade the system and move the drivers' users to this service.	"
negative;"Often the pedal-assisted BikeMi are empty.	"
positive;"I think it would be better to have stations even in more peripheral areas of the city. Bikes are very functional but not very light.	"
negative;"The yellow bicycles often have gearbox problems, which do not remain 'fixed' but produce clicks on the pedals. In general, bicycles are very heavy	"
positive;"Because you have not thought of it before, I hope that it will become the privileged means for transport in the city.	"
negative;"I use it at peak times, I find difficulty in the availability and return of the bikes	"
positive;"I would equip the bicycles with child seats and improve the quality of electric bikes because they are often not efficient	"
positive;"I wish you could use the service even at night	"
negative;"bikes are often broken and poorly maintained the seat often goes down suddenly	"
negative;"the system is always broken then the quality of the bike is bad, above all the new bicycle that the chair is always broken	"
positive;"When the bike didn't hook right on the rack I hope there would be an alarm to warn me. When I hook it its hard to see the little light. Especially in summer, when the sun light is extremely strong.	"
positive;"More stalls and more functioning bicycles (tires that are always swollen, change gear and greasing of movement and cranks)	"
negative;"Very bad bikes	"
positive;"The gear changing system should be improved. Often it works badly, it does not hold third gear. It could even be useful to plan bikes without gearbox or with a different gearbox	"
negative;"suburban stations are often full in the evening and it is difficult to leave bicycles (ES milano hatch)	"
negative;"I often use the Porta Garibaldi station and often I don't find bikes and empty stalls	"
negative;"The risk of finding full stalls or a station that is not working or an electric bike that is empty or with tires on the ground is too high	"
positive;"Inflate the wheels of bicycles	"
positive;"make it even more capillary throughout the city	"
negative;"Leave the bikes at night.	"
positive;"Provide staggered forms of subscription also for times of use and / or to climb (like some ski lifts). Integrate the card into the RicaricaMi card (which must as soon as possible assimilate the Oyster system in use in London).	"
positive;"useful, convenient, fast for the city center. economic even if it would be opportune to verify the possibility of a multiple subscription for families with diversified fees.	"
positive;"bikemi is a great service, too bad when there are inconveniences at peak times, the morning with empty stalls and in the evening with full stalls at the stations. managing to make the bicycle change more fluid would be perfect. in my opinion, being a flat Milanese, the normal service should be strengthened rather than the e-bike one	"
negative;"The stations do not register the refund and often generate penalty problems.	"
positive;"Often the columns are out of service	"
positive;"More maintenance, the bikes almost always have brakes or gears that don't work	"
positive;"More attention to bike maintenance, increase the number of stalls in the suburbs (white flies) and invest more in the construction of cycle paths.	"
positive;"MUCH MORE THAN SUFFICIENT	"
positive;"Most expensive red bikes at any time	"
positive;"A bicycle should also be designed for children aged 10 to 16 to cover all age groups	"
positive;"Improve maintenance and start the service from early morning, 7.00 am already late: I would suggest at least from 6.00 am. Then the rest is fine	"
positive;"I am very satisfied with the service. The only flaws are the heaviness of the yellow bikes and the absence of cycle paths.	"
negative;"there is no station in the Via Piranesi area, where I work	"
positive;"I am very interested in the possibility of adding child seats!	"
negative;"I really appreciate this service, but I often find bicycles really difficult to use (braking pedaling, deflated wheels, brakes locked). I would appreciate a little more maintenance or at least the possibility to point out that the last bike I used has problems in order to direct maintenance.	"
negative;"Great service, shame about the condition of the bikes that are not always perfect	"
positive;"I would like to be able to give an evaluation to the bike once it is returned to the station, for example to report problems. I would like to be able to book the bike in exceptional cases. I would like more places to park, especially during peak hours or evenings.	"
negative;"include in the subscription also the limited use of electric bikes	"
positive;"It would require more maintenance for bikes in general and for electric bikes in particular and better management of space in the racks	"
positive;"the bicycles turn out to be a bit heavy compared to the personal bicycle	"
negative;"good as service but poor maintenance	"
negative;"two problems: the lack of a bike in the morning near the station (central in my case) and the racks always or almost always full in the morning from nine o'clock, which forces you to take long laps on other 3 or 4 or 5 or even more racks to find a free stall	"
positive;"I am generally satisfied with the experience, only that lately I am experiencing inconvenience due to the suppression of the piazza partisan resistance station, due to the works for the M4 metro. The nearest station is buggy and it's not close!	"
positive;"Improve the rotation to allow for return	"
positive;"It is very convenient and useful, it would be nice that electric bikes were always a minimum and that they were also free only for the first half hour. The yellow bikes could be more agile and a little lighter and more manageable. It would be nice to put even more station outside the center	"
positive;"Sometimes and at peak times (leaving the offices, etc.) there are not always bicycles available	"
positive;"Repair the bikes	"
positive;"The municipality should set the pavements and increase the slopes. BikeMi is optimal for stimulating evolution in this sense	"
positive;"Good but I would improve the bikes. Furthermore, insert in the app the possibility of being able to identify if the stations are full (in key points it can become a problem not finding space - eg train station)	"
positive;"Great customer service. Requests for workstations in neighboring municipalities (eg Sesto San Giovanni). You have to get the cylinders everywhere, it is unthinkable that today you are risking being on the road by bike	"
positive;"One of the beautiful things of Milan	"
negative;"It should be possible to evaluate the state of the used bicycle, if it has problems with the gearbox or with the pedals or other	"
negative;"Missing area deception stations	"
negative;"the idea is wonderful, but in practice there are many things that do not work: 1) it would take more bike paths, at least a network that connects all bikemi stations 2) the bikes must be maintained continuously, it is not possible to allow that you pick up a bike and then you discover that it does not work, broken brakes, low battery, etc. etc. also because then you can not replace unless you wait tot minutes 3) the system of hook and unhook is cumbersome tiring difficult for nothing functional	"
positive;"I am generally fairly happy. I can't stand the fact that there are no seats in some stations, and that it has been going on for 1 year and that new stations have not been entered, or that existing ones have been enlarged.	"
positive;"√†ÀÜ A service	"
positive;"I find that for a girl to be heavy in the unhooking phase hang up, moreover often in the arc of peace in the evening I cannot return it because in 3 stations there are no free places	"
negative;"often the posts are full and you have to go too far from your home. In more often the pedals are ruined and the bike makes a strange noise. Even the brakes are often noisy	"
positive;"I am very satisfied with this service. I believe that the annual subscription price is excellent. I suggest finding a system that will provide the CARICA eBike when required. I often happened to unlock an eBike with only a battery notch and it was more tiring to go with yellow bikes. One thing to do by the municipality is to increase the city's cycle paths: cycling in Milan is still rather risky. Another thing I suggest is to increase the number of stations.	"
positive;"Ok	"
positive;"very useful and cheap service. the only flaw the area in via Tito Livio is discovered by BikeMi stations	"
positive;"I FIND YOU NEED A STATION IN PIAZZALE UDINE AND STRENGTHEN THE LAMBRATE AREA	"
positive;"insert it automatically into the students' ATM subscription	"
negative;"Pay attention to the problem of empty parking lots when you have to withdraw and fill them when you have to leave	"
positive;"Improve the bike pickup and storage system. For older people they are too heavy to lift	"
negative;"Many bikes have operating problems, more maintenance should be carried out. Few cycle lanes especially in central areas sometimes make it dangerous	"
positive;"Integrate the cost of the annual pass within the one for public transport	"
positive;"It is a very good service managed very well.	"
positive;"Lately racks are often empty and the bike handling service should be improved and some stalls doubled	"
positive;"Great	"
negative;"They need to be dangerous, and they can be dangerous. Further, the new bikes also have this gear sticking problem which is not ideal. Also, the availability of bikes is good, but often the stations in the center get very full up very early in the morning (around 9 / 9.30).	"
positive;"Good service, maintenance of yellow bikes to improve so much - The changes do not work well and are necessary given the weight of the bike	"
positive;"INFLATE BIKE RUBBERS - Increase station movement,	"
positive;"Great	"
positive;"General positive operation, although some areas are poorly covered in terms of stations present and the redelivery system is not always effective	"
positive;"Improve the integration with the app, often not updated with the number of really free bays, Increase the number of bays in the eastern area of ‚Äã‚ÄãMilan (Piola-Lambrate-Citt√† studi). Optimize the location giving priority to areas with high student concentration (Campus Martinitt, Campus Rubattino). Good Work ^^	"
positive;"Possibility to leave a bike immediately if a defect is detected (eg electric bike unloaded) without waiting. Service in general is both well constructed and economically advantageous	"
positive;"I am satisfied with the service. the main problem I noticed going to my previous job was the time spent looking for a free station. I'm sorry that with the winter time you can't use the bikes all night, I don't understand why	"
negative;"good brakes, but careless tire pressure and front lights or post. often broken	"
positive;"Some stations are always full or always empty (peak times). It would be useful to add stations or to bring / remove bikes from the stalls.	"
positive;"All in all, my experience is very positive, but what does not satisfy me is generally the fact that bikes are very heavy and bulky, bike stations are often located very far from one another, and in my opinion it would be necessary to make a price discrimination between those who use the bike more and those who use it less. For example, during the 3 months of summer there are not but I pay for the same service and besides I am not a daily user but only occasional and of convenience. In this it would be useful to make me pay less. I am also a non-resident student who does not work and, although 3 euros a month are not excessive, I believe that managers who use it every day and earn and have an income should pay for me or almost. If the service is public, in this the administration of the Democratic Party should intervene, facilitating social cohesion supported by sharing the same service from different users. Sorry for the long answer	"
positive;"EXCELLENT SERVICE - IT IS REQUIRED TO INCREASE THE AVAILABLE STALLS	"
positive;"reducing the weight of bicycles would be very welcome for us women	"
positive;"Happy even if some have worn brakes. Furthermore, e-bikes often take too long to start the engine, so at a traffic light you have to pedal hard to start	"
positive;"I often find problems in finding bicycles to use / park bicycles in use in the nearest stalls and useful for my purposes	"
negative;"sometimes the parking lots are full and it becomes a problem, putting the bike back in its place is a bit uncomfortable	"
positive;"I find bike extremely useful for living Milan in a healthier way and free from the media. I ask bikes to keep a good supply of bikes at peak times (often the stations are empty morning and evening most popular times) I tried the new bikes r they are not comfortable: too heavy to lift and handle	"
negative;"Sometimes the gearbox, brakes, wheels do not work well ...	"
negative;"Unfortunately the station in front of my work in via bergognone has now been dismantled for road works and I can no longer use the service even though I have renewed my subscription. I have not been notified nor reimbursed.	"
positive;"it would be very useful to be able to report the quite frequent anomalies. and in the case of unsatisfactory means, not having to wait a long time for replacement	"
positive;"Bikes should be ""treated better"" by users and employees	"
positive;"I would like a bike station in the Corvetto square that leads to a cycle path. Currently it is necessary to reach Brenta as a useful first station	"
negative;"Overall, the service is very useful but it is always more and more difficult to find a bike in the evening and many times the stations, even if they have bikes, do not allow the picking and this is very annoying	"
positive;"Unfortunately, due to the suppression of several stations for the work of the MM4, it has become very difficult to pick up or return the bikes in certain areas of the center at certain times. Furthermore, the totems do not signal nearby stations with free stalls.	"
positive;"Very convenient and cheap. I get on very well, even if I often find yellow bicycles with malfunctions to the gearbox or to pedal	"
negative;"FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM THAT I FIND ALWAYS THE FULL STATIONS AND I HAVE TO TURN NEARBY TO FIND OTHER STATIONS WHERE TO STORE THE BIKE	"
positive;"charge more for the service but make it work better. make sure that bikes are always available and that there is a place to store, that is to say replace the stations.	"
positive;"Improve bicycle maintenance	"
positive;"1) Bibiclette heavy and unwieldy. 2) Good coverage in the city to improve in the suburbs	"
negative;"It often happens that you hang up the bicycle while an operator is present for picking up or laying other bicycles, but the system does not incorporate the hang up of my bicycle. (Obviously after asking the operator if I can hang up, answer: ""sure!"".) It's a pity that after two hours the e-mail of no bicycle delivery arrives.	"
positive;"The service is great, but the bikes are too heavy, especially the red ones are not so fast / light / comfortable	"
negative;"very satisfied. The only problem: bike maintenance is not always effective (the gearbox often jumps while pedaling)	"
positive;"Improve bike maintenance	"
positive;"the stations in the center of milan especially the cathedral area are too small those in the cathedral area should double their capacity, electric bikes are too often discharged	"
positive;"often bike stations are not available. in the quadronno area there aren't enough bikes. on yellow bikes, maintenance is never done and electrical ones are often discharged	"
positive;"Positive. I need to know the remaining credit when I put the card in the parking lot	"
positive;"The service as a whole is really good, useful and well thought out. You need an app that, based on your location, immediately gives the nearest station with an available bike. Do it, what does it take! The weak side is the state of maintenance of the bikes. The main shortcomings are: 1 the 3-speed gearbox of yellow bikes, almost always out of register and with long non-usable gear, 2 the deflated tires which, being rather heavy bikes, make pedaling difficult.	"
negative;"lack stalls near the lambro park	"
positive;"The availability of free seats in the racks should be increased. It happens to have to leave the bike and not find a single free position in 4 racks. This is a problem, especially in winter	"
positive;"Thick red bikes don't work	"
positive;"I use it occasionally and I am satisfied with the service	"
positive;"Bicycles need more maintenance (brakes, pedals, gearbox). The stations could still be increased especially in peripheral areas.	"
positive;"yellow bicycles are very heavy and often need more maintenance (especially gearboxes). You could also think about opening the bike park, including some without the gearbox	"
negative;"The only negative note is about the condition of the bikes, which is not always adequate. better maintenance would be needed. Overall, I still feel satisfied.	"
negative;"more maintenance on bicycles that do not always work optimally	"
positive;"battery and bike control	"
positive;"I like it very much, I use it willingly, I already said above what doesn't work. Thanks	"
positive;"Great	"
positive;"improve maintenance and distribution	"
positive;"Excellent and functional service, one of the best in the world	"
positive;"improve the quality of yellow bikes	"
negative;"I find it a wonderful service, but it can be perfected with regard to the maintenance of the vehicles (mainly the gearshift that often goes off pedaling), the functioning of the columns that I have found out of many times out of use and have forced me to walk at times, losing the coincidences with trains, I also had some problems in the coupling phases as the bike inserted is not always read.	"
positive;"there are often bikes with gearbox or saddle problems and I don't know how to communicate them. It could be useful to foresee it upon delivery via the station screen	"
positive;"So, the only thing that's not good for me is that often when you go to a stall you don't find electric bikes, or you find them empty, or sometimes even if the LED is green the turret doesn't detect them and you don't can withdraw. To solve it, the only solution, in my opinion, is to put more electric bikes into circulation. Thank you if you do it if you don't slam	"
positive;"positive, the only drawback the type of bicycles and the fact that it happens with a certain frequency are not completely in place	"
negative;"The bike is heavy to lift. Can't the coupling point be lowered a bit?	"
positive;"Activate 24-hour service	"
positive;"The night service was very welcome, it would be convenient to have it all year round and not only in summer	"
negative;"Lately problems finding bikes available	"
positive;"Increase the number of stations in peripheral areas, including because the gears often work poorly	"
positive;"start replacing bikes with more technological models	"
negative;"Problems I'm having with the BikeMi system: 1. if I choose an electronic bike, I will check it out if there is charged, but when I go to select it give me a random bike and if they are not charged wont take it because its very heavy to ride. However, the system will block me to try another time. So I can't take a bike anymore and have wasted lots of time. 2. Parking is a very big problem for me. There is no parking when I go to work around 9:30 am to the least 2 other parking stations to take my trip. 3. The app does not have a GPS so I don't know where I am. Being a foreigner in the city	"
positive;"the service is a pride and I am proud of it as a Milanese. however, more attention should be paid to vehicle maintenance. for the rest YOU ARE GREAT!	"
positive;"Excellent experience, generally very satisfactory service.	"
positive;"We need more cycle paths!	"
positive;"Greater control of the functionality of bicycles	"
positive;"There are full stations and you can't leave the bike, so one has to go look for another station.	"
negative;"Insufficient stations and stalls per station (often occupied and later), inadequate night time (to be extended)	"
positive;"Multiple stations or integrated GPS to better locate them anywhere	"
positive;"The new yellow bikes are unusable by a woman, really too heavy! Better the old ones :)	"
positive;"positive	"
positive;"Check the hooks and the status of the bikes. For the rest ok.	"
positive;"very satisfied. Milan is difficult for bikes.	"
positive;"MAKE SURE THE MAIN MAINTENANCE OF THE STATIONS (OFTEN THE STAGES DO NOT WORK WELL)	"
positive;"Great very useful service. From time to time the stalls are full and sometimes totally empty so you can't really rely on them. Bikes are beaten from time to time and there is no way to replace them if a problem is discovered. For the rest I was one of the first to adopt it and I find it excellent	"
positive;"It is very useful but it lacks a network of suitable cycle paths that really makes the bicycle and bike me a valid alternative means	"
positive;"Brakes don't work	"
positive;"loyal user and generally satisfied with the service	"
negative;"the service is smart but is very limited by the location of the stations. They are all a center. There isn't one in Stazione Lambrate or the eastern suburbs.	"
positive;"Please dont close stations without notice. San Ambrogio has been closed and we have no idea if it will return. also the statioon at piazza partigiani, near corso italy are closed for MM4 work but we need bkies as traffic too congested now. please restore stations somewhere else near the original stations.	"
negative;"Always empty red bikes, stations not always replenished	"
positive;"I am satisfied with the service in general. I would improve the maintenance of the service of yellow (mechanical) bikes, too many times they are deflated or have other problems. Red (electric) bikes very often do not have / have minimal support battery	"
negative;"the only problem is that there are not always bikes available	"
positive;"Great service, too often though red bicycles have problems. And I would also extend the hours of use late at night, if not even 24 hours a day. Thank you	"
positive;"Thanks first of all for being there! By now more and more often alas there are problems in finding electric bicycles, in finding them in good condition and in the management of the stalls (intake and return). Good job!	"
negative;"Bicycles are often not functioning or partially functioning. It would be advisable to include a feedback evaluation at the end of each rental in order to proceed with the repair of faulty vehicles.	"
negative;"My experience was on average good, too bad for the yellow bikes, which often have inherent defects in the gearbox or brakes	"
positive;"fly in the ointment not to find a bike park because busy	"
negative;"percentage of broken or malfunctioning bicycles too high	"
negative;"Lately I have had problems with the stations: or deactivated (today I tried 3 in a row) or already full, with the impossibility to leave the bike.	"
negative;"Very often electric bikes are not charged. We could provide a tool in the arm app that allows you to report problems that the bike has by entering the number of the bike and the station	"
positive;"maintenance is not enough	"
positive;"Excellent and satisfying. More maintenance on bikes	"
positive;"absolutely improve and renew the yellow bike park	"
positive;"this service should be more open to foreigners ... for example, this survey asks the 'birth province' and only expects the response to be italian. i am from chicago. so, please, you have to bet more on the foreign market. i think this service is wonderful ... and anytime i have a problem, i can call you and i helped you immediately. after 11 years in italy, the bikemi customer service is the best i have ever experienced, so thank you. congratulations. but i have some suggestions. the stations to the difficult to find, the suggestions to the GPS option on the bikemi app, because they often take the bike but can't find a place to leave it because the stations are full. and then I have a penalty because I pass the time limit while looking for a station to park. i think that 40 minutes is a bit more reasonable, and as a better method of finding places to ride, not only FINDING a bike. but i appreciate this service very much, and i applaud it, and want to improve to the best it can be.	"
negative;"I find it more difficult to pick up electric bikes. There are but not delivery	"
positive;"improve gearbox maintenance, often the gear shifts.	"
negative;"I would remove the gear. In Milan, a flat city, it is not necessary and often causes problems for the bike	"
positive;"Enhance the network in peripheral areas of the city	"
positive;"Expand the network of stations even in the suburbs + improve the quality of the bikes (often the gears do not engage)	"
positive;"If the racks are full it is not possible to leave the bike and unintentionally overcome time	"
negative;"I think a more frequent relocation of the bicycles is necessary, especially in the morning range. In the 3 stations around my house, at h. 8.30 the bikes available are always very few, only traditional. I think more maintenance is needed, saddles that do not hold the hooks, broken gearboxes, destroyed knobs.	"
positive;"You must be able to go at night	"
positive;"Extend hours of use as was done in the summer	"
positive;"Improve the quality and efficiency of bicycles	"
negative;"Bicycles are almost always in poor condition (brakes, saddle, gearbox)	"
positive;"There are too many bikes that cannot be taken with the red light .... around 19-20 in the center (cathedral area) I never find the bikes	"
positive;"To improve the yellow bicycles, too many times I had to change with another for technical or mechanical reasons	"
positive;"Improve the status of bicycles.	"
negative;"Bikes too often have gearbox problems	"
positive;"put a lunigiana tram copolinea station + improve yellow maintenance	"
negative;"Stations are not always adequately managed (few bikes in the evening in the workplace and too many in residential areas). Bicycles often have problems	"
negative;"The Lotto stop is ALWAYS without bikes in the evening.	"
positive;"I find the service convenient, give the possibility of couple or group rentals I consider it an excellent opportunity and I would put on the bike the possibility of the navigator or in any case of a device that allows the fixing of the smartphone to view the directions	"
positive;"Increase positions outside and extend hours 24 hours	"
positive;"great experience, too bad I can't take my kids because there isn't a seat	"
positive;"I consider it a GREAT service	"
positive;"it would be useful to have some bikes near BisceglieM1, just to be able to park far away and reach the metro.	"
positive;"generally satisfied except sometimes for the condition of the bikes	"
positive;"It's a smart service. Milan is growing due to the use of cycle paths. I hope you continue to create new ones. I would like an expanded service out of the second ring of the circumference. I would be a more regular user	"
positive;"place new stations - also temporary - where there are the works of the new underground line - Corso genova-Conca del Naviglio area	"
negative;"in the morning in the center, the stalls are often full and making the bike difficult	"
positive;"great service, only flaw should be more stations	"
negative;"Negative notes: The change of some traditional bicycles does not work well. Once the gear was engaged the pedals ""click"" and at the start I risked falling more than once and in the race I skidded. Electric bicycles often don't work even if the indicator shows 4 green lights. All bikes sometimes don't brake or nail their wheels. You should improve the maintenance service. The bikes are heavy and pick-up and delivery are not always easy as the bike must be lifted and not a little.	"
positive;"Make bikes lighter, like those in the town of Corbetta (Mi)	"
positive;"Heavy to hook and unhook. Horizontally it would be better	"
positive;"Good	"
positive;"it would take more bike maintenance	"
positive;"It would take a child seat on some bikes	"
negative;"there are often no places to look after them	"
positive;"Lighter and more manageable bikes	"
negative;"Satisfaction is high! The only criticism is that on many yellow bicycles spent they have technical problems. Pedals make a ""click""	"
negative;"Very often the bikes are malfunctioning and delivery with increasingly full racks is becoming increasingly difficult. Really stressful!	"
negative;"great service for the city but the bikes sometimes have the change that works badly	"
positive;"more assiduous brake and bike mechanics control	"
positive;"Transform penalties into fines instead of canceling the card	"
positive;"Bravi	"
positive;"Spreading further, more stations, more functional bicycles, with Cargo for grocery shopping, lighter and cleaner !!!	"
positive;"Bike too heavy	"
positive;"Further extend the area served. Bring free use time to 45-60 minutes.	"
positive;"it's a great vehicle in the city	"
negative;"Difficult to leave the bike downtown at peak times	"
negative;"lately the bikes with assisted pedaling do NOT work and it is difficult to return bikes to the center	"
negative;"I think the service is very useful, for this only at the 2nd annual pass, but some areas have the stalls of distant bikes / very few bike paths and lots of smog. In short, what should be a moment of leisure becomes a stress (pedestrians that insult you because you're on the sidewalks and drivers insulting you because you're on the road). So where do we have to go around on the bike ???	"
negative;"excellent availability of stations. vehicles with poor maintenance and often the transmission / transmission works badly	"
positive;"enable Bikeme card for payment of public transport	"
positive;"improve the mechanics of traditional bicycles, often malfunctioning and in any case heavy and slow	"
positive;"Useful in the days of the strike of the vehicles or their delays	"
positive;"The pick-up time should be extended throughout the night because it is a valid alternative to taxis	"
positive;"in general the service is very good. Sometimes however it happens that the bike is not in order from the mechanical point of view (saddle, tires or other). It is very important that users always find means in order otherwise they soon become disaffected	"
negative;"the operation of the gearbox and of the bicycles is very different from bike to bike and is always a source of uncertainty but above all often push to interrupt the use	"
positive;"yellow bikes often not working / malfunctioning	"
positive;"satisfied	"
positive;"improve maintenance	"
positive;"Extension also in the province	"
positive;"Everything perfect, many bikes have gearbox problems, it would be very useful to be able to use them even at night when there are no more ATM vehicles	"
positive;"Improve the appearance and functionality, making the chassis lighter and improving the transmission system, increase the number of stalls and improve the app to be able to instantly see the availability of parking or pick up, increase visibility through more adequate stalls of stands ( take a look at the subway signs visible from afar.	"
positive;"I wish I could report bike problems	"
negative;"need more maintenance for bicycles. the new yellow bikes are very uncomfortable and heavy. very often I don't find slots available to leave the bike. I don't understand why when only one bike remains, it is always unavailable	"
negative;"If a pick-up bike malfunctions and you want to return it, you have to wait 5 minutes to get another one. This becomes a disservice. The wait in this case is too long. The return of the broken bike in the same station where it was taken must allow immediate change	"
positive;"The possibility to book the bike forward, like 10min before.	"
positive;"I FIND THE MOST COMFORTABLE CODES THAT THE CARD AS THE LOST THEN AND THE COST TO REST IT IS EXCESSIVE	"
positive;"Absolutely positive BikeMi experience. It would be even more so with a station closer to home (via watt / via morimondo)	"
negative;"the bikes are heavy, the handlebars are awkward	"
positive;"Several times I find yellow malfunctioning bikes, otherwise it is good service ..	"
negative;"LOW MAINTENANCE	"
positive;"I would add bikemi to all metro stations, even the most peripheral ones	"
negative;"Bicycles are often uncomfortable because they have breakdowns	"
positive;"Little correspondence between call center and debit mail. Talk about it more	"
positive;"I am very satisfied with the bikemi service, I would like there to be more bike lanes and to point out that traditional bikes are often broken or heavy	"
negative;"I believe it is necessary to improve the reliability of the bike return system (often the coupling is done correctly but not recorded by the system) and the state of maintenance of traditional bikes, which often have problems with the pedals and the gearbox	"
positive;"I use it little, as an alternative to the scooter when it is very cold, now that even in winter it can be used in the evening I am very happy	"
positive;"I am satisfied, call for more control on brake saddles and gearboxes	"
positive;"transmission does not work once in three, maybe another mechanism would be less fragile	"
positive;"You should make an App that replaces the paper card, for subscriptions	"
positive;"Bicycles need to be serviced more often, often something does not work or the chain does not turn well, the gears are jammed. They are often dirty and in a poor state of maintenance. The cycle paths must certainly be increased, this would induce everyone to use the service with greater security and tranquility, because in fact it is a fundamental service for a city like Milan.	"
negative;"often the stalls are full and you can't leave the bike, often wasting a lot of time looking for another one. it would take more stalls in the suburbs. the stall stall square should be restored	"
negative;"OFTEN THE STALLS ARE FULL, OR THEY ARE COMPLETELY EMPTY, PREVENTING USE. IN THE CENTER ESPECIALLY	"
positive;"give the opportunity through the app to report bike malfunctions (deflated wheels, brakes, saddle change etc.)	"
positive;"Electric bikes are often empty, and the workstations in the center are always full and the parking is not very difficult	"
negative;"Unfortunately, more maintenance. I realize that the real problem is the improper or incorrect use of some users.	"
negative;"the stations are not done well: often users put the bike back on the wrong side, making all the bikes useless around the badly parked one. You should review this	"
negative;"I can train myself by going to the University to work. without finding a free day for cycling.	"
negative;"sometimes as soon as you leave the bike you get a red error message that sets itself up after a few minutes	"
positive;"Great service, to improve the state of maintenance of the bikes often problematic on brakes and pedals that ""shell"".	"
negative;"electric bikes 9 times out of 10 are empty and it is not possible to change them immediately to take a normal one	"
positive;"extend the service to more peripheral areas	"
positive;"Make an efficient service available to report inefficiencies (broken bike) via the app, without calling. For telephone communications, prepare a dedicated toll-free number (not ATM)	"
negative;"Too few parking problems with broken system hooks that work badly	"
positive;"Great service, you absolutely must increase the stalls in the congested areas	"
positive;"give the possibility to pick up the bicycle even at 5 in the morning, so you can also use it to go to the train station.	"
positive;"extend the time of use throughout the night.	"
positive;"frequent changes to six classic bike models have led to very variable performances in terms of comfort and speed and possible efforts. appear to be unreasonable for a user like me who has practically used them of all kinds. the maintenance of the same in primis the pressure of the tires and the brakes appear little managed. grease the barrel of a saddle to make it slide better is deficient. then it doesn't get stuck and it's dangerous and uncomfortable. would you do it with YOUR bike? the newer saddles seem to be made for American seats than for Italians. front light can be improved in night / winter use. the problem of cycle paths remains. of their access and withdrawal from / to the street. certainly a good idea of ‚Äã‚Äãservice for a flat city like Milan. I would oblige the managers of your company to go around the streets with the current means and on the cycle paths of today (real or virtual) to bring these feedback you request directly from the field. bad ass. a couple of flights in the rails. going first as a splinter or a snail with a bus next door will undoubtedly add value and arguments to the next meeting of business plans or operations meetings review. I leave you	"
negative;"More care for bicycles - many have gearbox problems and electric ones are sometimes unloaded - plus there are full bays in the evening near the station and empty in the morning	"
positive;"Very satisfied, I wish there were BIKEMI stations in via Varesina (which has a nice cycle path)	"
positive;"It would be great to have a continuous pick-up time.	"
positive;"Positive, but bike maintenance needs to be improved	"
positive;"It could be considered free for users who have an annual subway subscription	"
negative;"Definitely satisfied but the bikes are sometimes in pitiful conditions, especially the brakes and tires, and therefore become dangerous. And I say this even when I'm on the way and I see other bikeme users on the street, with obviously broken bikes and at risk of an accident.	"
positive;"Great service but better care of bicycles would be desirable. Many times they have a broken gearbox or malfunctioning brakes	"
positive;"Often the stations are full and this makes it impossible to return the bicycle. Traditional yellow bicycles are often malfunctioning.	"
positive;"I am happy with the service, which however needs to be strengthened and a management (software?) Of the number of bikes at the stalls is needed to prevent the bicycle from being left too far from the destination. When this happens (and it rarely happens) the same logic of using the vehicle that is born and must be a public vehicle not only for leisure and leisure but a means that integrates with other means of transport available in the city . Critics, however, do not want to overshadow the great importance of service.	"
negative;"The maintenance of yellow bikes is very bad! When picking up, I often find them with operating problems: pedals, gearbox, brakes, etc.	"
positive;"A little more maintenance would not hurt, the brakes work from time to time, the screws to weld the saddle are often worn. In general they are very heavy bikes but oh well.	"
negative;"at peak times it is difficult to find empty parking lots	"
positive;"Thanks to the IT support, the flow of withdrawals / deposits in the stations during points periods should be better anticipated and the problem of bike lack / overcrowding (eg station 184 often empty in the morning, station 163 often full at the same time) should be prevented - service opening at 6 am - 24/7 service extension on weekends throughout the year	"
negative;"In the case of a bicycle picked up with technical problems there is no possibility to signal it to the station and take a functioning one immediately afterwards.	"
negative;"Bad bike maintenance (tires, gearbox, brakes, saddles). It happens too often to find stations all empty or full, you have to move them more with vans	"
positive;"EXPAND THE SERVICE TO THE OUTSKIRTS AND EXTEND THE TIME	"
negative;"more maintenance! Many bikes don't work anymore, it's dangerous. increase the number of stations even in areas outside the dockside ring road.	"
positive;"It would be useful to be able to take the bike after one at night	"
positive;"I would like bicycles to be in better condition with the bike not jerky because the chain is badly placed or the saddle is not as uncomfortable as your bicycles are	"
positive;"STATIONS ARE LITTLE. OR YOU DON'T FIND BIKES OR FIND PARKING. FINALLY, YOU CANNOT COUNT WITH THE CERTAINTY OF SERVICE	"
positive;"Bicycle paths are the first step	"
positive;"Maintenance of yellow bikes should be increased	"
positive;"I work late, sometimes even after 2 am, and I'd like to be able to take the bike at all hours.	"
positive;"The penalties are too restrictive	"
positive;"It would be necessary to increase the biki car parks in semi-central areas	"
negative;"very often in the evening some stations are empty and I have to walk to the next and the distance between them is not always short	"
positive;"More maintenance for bikes	"
negative;"in the morning in the center the stations are full and parking is difficult	"
negative;"In the bike station should be the option to signal how the bike does not work well - the brakes, gearbox, ...	"
negative;"The station empties already at 8:30	"
positive;"In my opinion it must be a 24-hour service, it ends too soon	"
negative;"The parking lots are empty often or with few bikes that cannot be taken and are often full, creating problems in the return	"
negative;"Sometimes there are electric bikes that are not working. Problems with the saddle that adjusts badly and sometimes you just can't adjust. You must activate a simple system to allow you to report any problems after delivery.	"
positive;"Improve bike distribution to facilitate parking. Increased bike maintenance (especially brakes).	"
positive;"Very useful, increase the frequency of vehicle maintenance	"
negative;"Add possibility to report faults	"
negative;"it would be useful to be able to report any faults / problems regarding the bike used	"
negative;"LAMENTATION ISSUES IN YOUR ORGANIZATION - DO NOT FIND ALMOST NEVER PLACED TO LEAVE IT IN THE DUOMO-PIAZZA FONTANA-BECCARIA STATIONS AT 8.50 AM OF MATIIMNO	"
positive;"bike maintenance needs to be more effective and yellow bikes almost all have gearbox problems	"
negative;"Beautiful idea but it is not suitable for those who live from the ring roads towards the center and the bikes are often defective	"
positive;"There should be more ebikes	"
positive;"Excellent and plentiful :)	"
negative;"bikes are often poorly maintained, full of pedaling problems ... should be placed more often	"
positive;"I also need it at night	"
positive;"improve the bikes	"
negative;"Good service, too bad that I can't use them every day because the service does not arrive in the Affori area. I also requested by email.	"
negative;"very satisfied with the service in general, less than the state of the bikes (on the electric one there are often problems / do not work) and the stations are often full / empty.	"
positive;"Extending the network to the whole city, putting part of the costs on the general cost of LPT (about a + 3%) spread over the tariff as a whole	"
positive;"more robust transmissions or quieter users	"
positive;"we need to improve bike maintenance because it leaves something to be desired	"
positive;"Most efficient app, still too frequent failures	"
negative;"extend pick-up times to eliminate blocking hours. What are they for?	"
positive;"Greater control of pedals and brakes	"
positive;"often full stalls	"
negative;"I find blocked service stations, a serious inconvenience when I have little time	"
negative;"bicycles are often broken, a shopping basket would be useful	"
negative;"with a certain frequency I happen to encounter problems of coupling in the stalls	"
negative;"Very good service but the quality of classic bikes is very bad	"
negative;"the bike attachment system is very uncomfortable, and the bikes are almost never in good condition, in particular the tire change and pressure	"
positive;"Points for improvement: increase the stalls or increase the manual movement of the bikes by the ATM workers, especially in the peak time bands (9: 00-9: 30	"
negative;"electric charging signal always on and more evident even when the bike is at rest in the stall	"
negative;"I am satisfied, too bad that no station has been installed all along Viale Monza. I live in that area and I still have to take the subway to Loreto to reach the nearest BikeMi station.	"
positive;"Improve electric bikes and more maintenance on standard ones	"
positive;"Paying after half an hour of free use of the bike cannot be heard.	"
negative;"I believe that a major flaw in the service is due to the app that is not very useful (it is difficult to visualize the map of the stations for example and you cannot do a search by way). Furthermore, often the bikes are defective, it would be interesting to be able to make a report via app.	"
positive;"Unfortunately, due to excellent service, bike maintenance often leaves something to be desired. It would be nice if the nightly restitution time was more extensive	"
negative;"I would appreciate a service on the app to quickly report broken / malfunctioning bikes in order to speed up repair / maintenance	"
negative;"Perfect. The only drawback is that working in the center the stalls are always busy and in order to avoid entering late for work, I am often forced to reintroduce myself to the bike. Moreover, especially in San Babila, it often happens in the morning that there is a bicycle change or maintenance by the employees who sometimes inserting new bikes go to remove the already scarce stalls available. In my opinion, they should do these operations at times far from those of entry and exit from work.	"
negative;"Unfortunately it often happens that the stations near the railway stations are full during peak times	"
positive;"From 10 onwards in the suburban stations there are no bikes, they are all in the center. In Milan there are so many Italians unemployed, fathers of families, take them to move the bikes or better yet a supervisor for each station! Thanks	"
positive;"CENTRAL PARKING AREAS ONLY. WHY NOT IN THE CITY STUDIES TO ES.?	"
positive;"GOOD to fix the paths	"
positive;"Take care of the efficiency of the bikes especially brakes and gearboxes	"
positive;"The night coverage of the service would be useful	"
negative;"The only negative aspect is the delivery system. I paid a penalty unfairly because the bicycle was not delivered. Several times I have to call to say that the light was red but the bike was delivered.	"
positive;"Spread stations in the suburbs especially near metro schools hospitals	"
positive;"Get out more from the center	"
negative;"overall good service, more attention should be paid to bike maintenance and stations ""emptying and filling"" service. Absolutely rejected the former red bikes turned into yellow impossible to use because very heavy	"
positive;"a better system would be appreciated for the change that often gets jammed	"
positive;"Good service, but you should put a station in front of every school, because right now I have to go to the nearest one, which is still far enough away, to go to school.	"
negative;"electric bikes are often ""empty"" and do not work. sometimes the release is not recorded when I leave the bicycle	"
negative;"Updating the collection / deposit spaces is not very efficient. It often happens that there is no room to store the bicycle.	"
positive;"monitor the status of bikes. enter stations in the lorenteggio area.	"
positive;"A better bike maintenance service would be useful, too often you will find bicycles that do not work well. I also don't understand why the 5 minutes of waiting between one use and the other, it happened to me to realize that the taken bike had a problem (brakes not working, pedals broken) and to want to leave it at the next station and take another and in this case it is annoying to have to wait for another one	"
positive;"Very positive. Only notes: often the yellow bikes are not fully functional and the red bikes are empty. I would extend the time in the morning to before 7.00 am.	"
positive;"Increase maintenance	"
negative;"change bikes even after 10 minutes (when it is not working well) and report faults immediately	"
positive;"I do not understand how often electric bikes even if they are not available	"
positive;"being able to report inefficiencies (deflated wheels) via APP	"
positive;"Extend the service at least until 3 am	"
negative;"Resettitution or difficult withdrawal in Central Station despite the already numerous withdrawal stations	"
positive;"Good service	"
positive;"more maintenance on bikes	"
positive;"I would like to have a location near my home. It could be the Forlanini passer-by stop, I would definitely use it more.	"
positive;"It would be useful to be able to indicate which bikes have problems to allow maintenance. I found many electric discharges and therefore unmanageable during use	"
positive;"Yellow bicycles are not in good shape. To increase the number of red bicycles. Sometimes there are bikes at the station but the system does not allow you to take them. Everything else is fine	"
positive;"More attention to bicycle breakdowns	"
positive;"I would pay even more (50-60 euros a year) to have the security of finding a place in the most external stations (Brenta, Bonomelli, Via Brembo) late at night (from 8 pm to 11 pm) when I come home from work	"
positive;"The morning arrival times are always full (via bergognone)	"
negative;"For low people, the bikes are quite uncomfortable!	"
positive;"More stalls are needed in the center	"
negative;"Most of the time the bikes are damaged and especially the brakes work badly	"
positive;"Increase the withdrawal points in the east area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe lambrate station, rogoredo, via asslli forlanini park Lambro	"
positive;"in the morning he cannot return the bike, recovery service too slow	"
positive;"delete the card as they did for the carsharing. Less unbalanced bikes on the front axle. Customer Care and reports via SMS and chat. Do not completely fill the stalls	"
negative;"The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service is good, unfortunately most of the time the bikes are broken or in bad condition which makes the circulation difficult as well as dangerous	"
negative;"Since bikes are often damaged and not perfectly functional, a non-paying service for reporting faults would be useful	"
negative;"Too bad there is no possibility of. To take out a subscription without a credit card but simply to put it on a current account, I simply haven't renewed it for this reason.	"
positive;"Good service. Assistance / maintenance of bicycles must be foreseen in the stalls in an efficient and intense manner	"
positive;"More stations and renewed batteries than electric ones	"
positive;"Given that I find the service very useful and very well organized, I believe that it is not correct to charge the cost (even if small) of electric bikes when these are deposited immediately after a few minutes after being discharged. I am referring to a specific case where I reported to the customer service of the malfunctioning of the bike but nevertheless I was charged for the service. I repeat it is not the figure but the principle. Thanks	"
positive;"increase maintenance of circumnavigating bikes and locations that are not always active	"
positive;"I suggest to ensure the functioning of the red bikes with assisted pedaling, essential to avoid ""strenuous"" pedaling due to the significant specific weight of the vehicle	"
positive;"Excellent but red bicycles are not very available. Furthermore they should also work towards the periphery	"
positive;"I have always used bikemi for any move. Having transferred the domicile to an area where there are no stations, I cannot use the service as I would like. I live in the Meda-Cermen area, I think an expansion of the service in more ""peripheral"" areas (which in reality are not) is fundamental, above all to allow the reaching of the subway stations in the shortest possible time.	"
positive;"improve maintenance to bikes with more controls, expand the service towards the periphery, make the occasional service payable with the card.	"
negative;"There are no parking spaces near Lambrate (Station).	"
negative;"I would like more attention to the state of the bikes, it often happens to me to find bikes with the gearbox that works badly or with the saddle hardly adjustable	"
negative;"In the last year I have almost never used the service: there are no stations very close to home, those nearby or are often empty or - unfortunately - always occupied by people who live in the little park and who dirty or damage bicycles. Near the office (via dante) the stops are inconvenient and in the morning without space to park, as well as being far from the reference number. At this point, given the journeys on foot that must still be made between racks etc, I arranged to go always and only on foot. Too bad because the service is very useful.	"
positive;"improve vehicle availability and maintenance (gearboxes and brakes in particular)	"
positive;"red bikes are too heavy	"
negative;"Bicycles are heavy and not very comfortable, they are often damaged with brakes that do not work or with rusted parts	"
negative;"In general I am satisfied with the service. To improve, I would extend the availability times of the bikes, both in the morning, at least from 6am and extend the evening. I often use the electric bike but I often find it difficult to find them because they are not available or are not working (the engine does not start). thanks	"
positive;"Check and adjust the gears	"
positive;"Greater maintenance	"
negative;"The stations near offices must be more equipped (see bergognone in front of deloitte). In the areas of Milan with the pav√® it is difficult to go by bike, more cycle paths would be needed. Put child seats on!	"
positive;"improving station management are often full and others empty	"
negative;"Pave is a disadvantage. the bikes are tough	"
positive;"Perhaps, a further commitment to bicycle maintenance	"
positive;"excellent service	"
positive;"Great	"
positive;"For Saturday nights put the summer schedule back on !!	"
positive;"Enthusiastic! I hope to open the Piazza Arduino area station. To go to the center the nearest station is in Amendola about 10 minutes on foot	"
positive;"efficiency of service and efficiency of bicycles can be improved but overall positive judgment	"
positive;"happy to use bike is good for my health	"
positive;"I would like some racks in the piazza Udine lambrate area	"
negative;"A pity the closing times of the night. Maybe open at 6 in the morning instead of 7.	"
positive;"I would like new stations, especially the Udine-Lambrate area	"
positive;"Too much difficulty in finding a free stall to leave the bike, at certain times of the day certain stalls are always full or empty	"
positive;"Sometimes there are bicycles (both yellow and red) in poor condition: broken brakes, tires that are deflated, seats that slip. It is clearly not your fault but the uncivilized ones that use them but at this point a more frequent and careful maintenance is needed.	"
positive;"I am generally satisfied with the service. I would ask, however, that the number of stalls in the stations be extended as much as possible and that the bikes be moved as far as possible with the use of the truck, so as to easily find stalls available for return and bicycles available at the time of collection. at peak times. Thanks.	"
positive;"however little I use it, I have repeatedly found that the station malfunctions to pick up or hang up the bike and I do not understand why it is not usable when there are no public transport while it would be a useful way to move	"
positive;"Please improve the management of withdrawal points. It has happened several times or not to find a bike or not find enough parking spaces	"
positive;"the service works very well. It should be more extensive in peripheral areas.	"
positive;"The bike redistribution system in the city needs to be improved and increased. Too often I don't find bikes at 8.30-9.00 in the morning and at 18.00 in the evening	"
positive;"VERY OFTEN THE CYCLE PATHS ARE USED AS TEMPORARY PARKING MAKE MORE CHECKS	"
positive;"Lately bike marches work less / I would add even more rattles in the city / put a roof in every rack to protect the bikes and make sure they don't get ruined quickly	"
positive;"Expand the service with stalls along Via Venini (Piazza Morbegno, Via Martiri Oscuri) and at the corner between Via Palestrina and Andrea Doria (there is parking for cars). Improve bike maintenance. When giving someone a subscription, this person must be notified by you with an email: I have had problems with it. Thanks.	"
negative;"Allow rapid reporting of badly functioning bicycles	"
positive;"good! to improve maintenance of yellow bikes	"
positive;"I BELIEVE THE SERVICE AS IT IS NOW MORE THAN SATISFACTORY. IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE ONLY A GREATER CONTROL OF THE YELLOW BICYCLES WHICH IT IS OFTEN HAVE TO HAVE ALSO PROBLEMS IF IT IS MINOR.	"
negative;"at peak times and at critical points (trenord stations) there should be more bikes or increase the filling speed of the empty spaces	"
positive;"It would be really useful to take better care of every vehicle (pedaling, chain / crown, gearboxes)	"
negative;"There are many stations that crash, they are not out of order but they are full of bikes that are not available. I am referring to the 3 stations in the Piazza 24 May area, full of bikes in the morning but not all available. it is not possible that they are all broken, otherwise there is another type of problem, that there are too many non-functioning bikes. Furthermore CREATE A DIRECT NUMBER FOR BIKE MI. It is not possible to have to wait for so many steps to be able to talk to the call center. You really want to report anything.	"
positive;"it would be enough to lighten the bike and to hook and unhook the bike would be easier	"
negative;"I'm glad there is something like this because it's a step towards a vision of the city on a human scale and not a car (traffic weighs down the air and the morale of the citizens). Unfortunately, BikeMi cannot be considered a reliable service as there are 15% of cases where the racks are empty / full. often this disservice knows no remedy but to resign itself to arriving late. The overall evaluation is very much affected by the logistic non-reliability ..	"
positive;"Close to Virgin Active (City Studies) We Need A Station	"
positive;"It would be nice to have stations further south than Ripamonti-De Angeli	"
positive;"A) review the bikes, B) add stations	"
negative;"The app is not always updated in real time and does not correspond to reality. If there is a station that does not go momentarily, only you realize when you get there, a disgrace. It should have some way of communicating the disruption of a bike when you leave it	"
negative;"5-star customer service, verified in a couple of situations. The problem is the lack of cycle paths	"
positive;"very positive	"
negative;"I love bikemi madness and I could not live without it, but more attention is needed to yellow bikes because many are broken and when it is picked up and does not work it is a big problem because I use it to go to work. the red ones are sometimes discharged and therefore very heavy to carry. the rest is ok, but taking care of the bikes is very important because if the pedals are broken or the brakes or saddle is not up it is a big problem.	"
positive;"If there were not, it would have to be invented but the maintenance of the vehicles and the effective usability of the stations should be implemented	"
negative;"The service is a great idea, the bicycles are unfortunately heavy and from the ""wrong"" center of gravity: they often fall even when stationary, with a tripod. In other cities (for example Paris) bicycles are much more reliable.	"
negative;"I often found bikes with non-functioning brakes. I think there should be a system of failure reporting	"
positive;"Luckily I have tried the new bicycle models a few times and they are definitely uncomfortable. I think there is a design error because the saddle is too far forward and you have difficulty pedaling. I hope you realize this before increasing the number of bikes you buy	"
positive;"satisfied	"
positive;"The service is brilliant, very useful and beautiful. But the maintenance is PESSIMA, there are too many bikes put in a circle with problems !!! The new bikes do not allow you to see the green light when they reposition, in fact you don't even see where to put the two stops! Who is that brilliant that got the idea? the same one who placed the seats on the Sirio and Sirietto trams so you don't pass when the passengers are seated on both sides of the tram?	"
negative;"current bikes are too hard and light	"
positive;"Improving bike maintenance, sometimes it's difficult to pedal because the gearbox ""changes"" on its own	"
positive;"1) The bike park must be renewed periodically	"
positive;"more than a few stations do not correctly record the return of the bike, triggering costs and penalties	"
positive;"The general experience is very positive. The maintenance of yellow bikes can be improved but the situation is generally acceptable, the strategic movement of the bikes with vans must be improved to avoid full or empty stations. The advantage for traffic is much higher than the traffic generated by vans. The van drivers seem to have no attention to the maintenance of the bikes, a minimum of intervention in some cases could simplify, for example to inflate the deflated wheels or straighten the saddles (often wrongly inclined, pointing upwards) it would not be necessary to move the bike in the workshop	"
positive;"More stations, more stalls	"
positive;"I would suggest not completely filling a station as it has happened several times to return in the evening and not find stalls available! And please adjust the brakes I can't destroy the soles of shoes all the time !!	"
negative;"Yellow bikes are very heavy and often have a broken gearbox. The hooking / unhooking system is definitely inconvenient, if a person does not have enough strength in his arm he is very difficult. The racks are often either too empty or completely full. In that case all the advantage of using the bike is lost, if then you have to look for another station, maybe too far away! Finally (in reality it is a bit 'that does not happen to me, but it was a constant until I switched exclusively to red bikes), the first bike assigned always had a problem is having to change implies a waste of time. Especially annoying in the morning when you have to rush to work.	"
positive;"better maintenance of both bikes and stalls	"
positive;"More maintenance for bicycles	"
positive;"do more maintenance	"
positive;"raise awareness among motorists	"
positive;"improve maintenance	"
negative;"my consideration is that the yellow bikes have now become too dangerous because nothing works. Broken brakes, the bell does not ring, the insertion of the gears is difficult.	"
positive;"At present, the comfort of bicycles (in terms of weight of the vehicle and seat not sufficiently adjustable) is not such as to allow me to use it frequently. Also near my home (Via Antonini area) there are still no stalls.	"
negative;"Advertising covering wheel spokes is dangerous because it causes the vehicle to skid, especially in windy weather conditions	"
positive;"I would like there to be a way to feel some miscarriage of the bike in use (eg lights, brakes, etc.).	"
positive;"Better care for maintenance and other cycle paths	"
positive;"SUPPLY OF STATIONS IS NOT ALWAYS RATIONAL AS I FIND STATIONS COMPLETELY FULL OR FULLY EMPTY. OFTEN THERE ARE ONLY 3-4 BIKES IN THE RACK WHICH, HOWEVER, CANNOT BE TAKED IS IT IS BUILT TO PASS TO THE NEXT ROPE. I WILL BE MORE GIVING YOU TO PAY 40 EURO INSTEAD OF 36 BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE YOUR BIKE. DRESS IN THE BOTTOM VIA RIPAMONTI BUT THERE ARE NO BIKES, TRAM 24 IS STRACOLMO, THEREFORE IF YOU CAN PUT BIKE STATIONS IN VIA RIPAMONTI (VALDISOLE) ACCORDING TO ME, YOU'LL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SEASON TICKETS. EVERYTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN INTO THE SERVICE, IN RELATION TO THE IRISOR PRICE IT WORKS ENOUGHLY GOOD FOR ME THAT I AM A SALTUARY USER.	"
negative;"Yellow bicycles are very heavy and not always in good condition	"
positive;"the service must be easier, the stations equipped better, absolutely yes to the seat for small children, there should be the possibility of marking a broken bicycle and for the abbnati to pre-lit the bicycle faster without waiting for minutes to recover one if it is defective. when they put the bikes back in their stalls, they are better off leaving a few free places, otherwise those who come to deliver it find it all busy in the area! more controls where there are no bikes and more island and cathedral stations	"
positive;"Increased bike and station maintenance. Inefficient bike attachment. It would be useful to be able to choose the bike to be taken based on the distance from the turret and seat height	"
positive;"It would be very useful to extend the time for using the bikes during the night. During the night and especially in the summer, the bicycle is the ideal way to get around.	"
positive;"problems finding bikes or free stalls in peak locations / times	"
positive;"Positive but more attention to the maintenance of the vehicles which is sometimes really insufficient	"
negative;"Red bikes are often missing or unloaded and cannot be replaced without repaying the rental.	"
positive;"too close to each other	"
negative;"Do not completely fill the racks when you reposition the bikes otherwise if you arrive after the bikemi pick-up there is no more space to attach the bike.	"
negative;"The pedal assisted bicycles often even if present in the parking lot are not recompressed by the system. The same, very often, do not work, they have low battery. Once taken it is not tolerable to have to wait 5 minutes to replace it with high probability that also the second one is not working.	"
positive;"We need a quick way to report the bicycle not working, like I take a picture of the number and send it or, maybe better, something to click on the totem during the redelivery	"
negative;"very heavy bikes, after the 21 empty parking lots, I change a nightmare	"
positive;"Great customer service, the bikes are a little heavy and uncomfortable, but I would recommend it	"
positive;"It would be useful to increase the stations in the Argonne-Fusina-Lomellina-Aselli area	"
negative;"A station is missing in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãViale Monza	"
positive;"It would be good to repair traditional bikes more often.	"
positive;"great service, yellow bicycles often have problems.	"
positive;"I finish working late at night and it is very difficult to find a bike in the center. make new stations in the center! :)	"
negative;"These bicycles are very heavy and it's tiring to unhook it and hook it to the stall.	"
positive;"THAT THE STATIONS ARE INCREASED AND NEEDED MORE	"
positive;"make that with the delivery email you can respond with the status of the bike	"
positive;"extend the stations even to less central areas	"
positive;"More maintenance of stations outside the center	"
positive;"Allow 40 minutes of free use at the beginning .. and plan to be able to keep the bicycle more than two hours .. they are absolutely insufficient	"
positive;"On some occasions I had the need to use the BikeMI before the opening time. I do not understand the meaning of having an opening time on a service that does not require the personnel present.	"
negative;"Bikes should be lighter. the most accurate maintenance. more bike paths are needed, especially where there is no alternative to paved roads.	"
positive;"In the areas of greatest work flow (central Milan) and during peak times, there are often no bikes to pick up, nor parking available to leave the bike. You should be more efficient during these hours 08.30-9.30 and 17.30-18.30 and empty the parking spaces if they are full of bikes and add bikes if the parking lots are empty.	"
positive;"The service should be active 24 hours	"
positive;"Especially in the summer it can happen to not find bikes in the most peripheral stations and not to find free stalls in the more central ones: this type of control could be a little improved.	"
positive;"It is necessary to implement the stalls in the historic center and make the bike removal and loading system more efficient through operators: in the morning you cannot park, in the evening you do not find a bicycle within a radius of km	"
positive;"I often find delivery stations without stalls. there is a station in corso monforte that after 20 has no bikes available (although they are present in the stalls) the time of use should be at least 3 hours. The app is fantastic	"
negative;"There is no convenient procedure to report damage. I need to send an email and write the rental references.	"
negative;"bikes often broken in gear shifting	"
positive;"1) FREQUENTLY TESTED CHECKS FOR SAFETY - AVAILABILITY (FOR EXCELLENT LODGINGS I HAVE DIFFICULTLY FINDING RED-QUNDO BIKES OFTEN FINDS ARE DOWNLOADED (IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO BE RELEASED ONLY BY BICYCLE BICYCLES) - IT WOULD BE GOOD ALSO CLOSE TO VIA DEI PANIGAROLA (VIA DEI CINQUECENTO VIA GABRIO ROSA) FACT IN THE AREA P.LE CORVETTO YOU DON'T FIND US THERE IS A RACK AND THE RSA WHERE MY INVALID MOTHER IS LIVING IT IS LOCATED IN VIA DEI PANIGAROLA- THE SELLINI OF BIKE GIALLE ARE REMOVAL - THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLOSING THE BIKE CHAIN ‚Äã‚ÄãARE NOT CLEAR.	"
positive;"increase stations and cycle paths	"
positive;"To improve maintenance: bikes often have flat tires or the brakes do not work well	"
positive;"Good service, not supported by cycle paths	"
positive;"More control over the condition of the bikes. Improve App	"
positive;"I have no suggestions to give. I am fully satisfied	"
negative;"I like this service ... but often you find broken bikes and if you want to change it you have to wait for the time that someone who has to work doesn't have. In the evening in Cadorna it is hard to find an empty seat. Thanks	"
positive;"It would be advisable to give the user the possibility to ""choose"" the bicycle - It would be desirable to improve the bike repositioning service - Make sure that the discharged electric ones are not withdrawable (too often one realizes afterwards with double the fatigue.	"
positive;"The bikes are normally in good condition, the first generation of yellow bikes is giving clear signs of aging, often the gears do not work well, the brakes are not very reliable and the saddle is difficult to adjust for the rest the service is very good so keep it up	"
positive;"Try to increase the racks available at Milan Central and stations in general	"
positive;"overall positive!	"
negative;"there are no stations in the suburbs	"
positive;"often the station I use is out of service for both electric and traditional bikes and this has a lot to do with my time management	"
positive;"the Yellow bikes would have to be a little more controlled in terms of structure once I didn't have the brake and I fell	"
positive;"I couldn't find any bikes at the pick-up station to go to work. So I preferred the tram and canceled my subscription because it can't be a reliable vehicle. I will use it for leisure by paying the single Withdrawal.	"
negative;"The main problem remains the stations that are completely full in the center in the morning and completely empty after 18.00	"
positive;"I would like the service to be more extensive at night. I also wanted to point out that yellow bikes with red bike frames are very heavy and unwieldy.	"
positive;"the eBike is always out of charge .. please pay attention to the yellow bike tires. Thank you	"
positive;"red / electric bicycles often not loaded	"
negative;"Some considerations if they can be useful. I have many colleagues who are not subscribers because they would rarely use bikemi, if the price of the annual pass was slightly lower, or if there were consumption formulas or for infrequent use, more people who normally use other means of transport would be encouraged . Furthermore, there are still some areas of the city that are badly served by stalls, such as the area around the Garibaldi station, which is always very congested by cars. I would suggest a stall in Via Fratelli Castiglioni, near Esselunga, Piazza Gae Aulenti and the station. Or in the area between Porta Venezia and Citt√† Studi.	"
positive;"You have to improve the management of the stations, when there is no place it is not convenient to look for another station when you have to go to work.	"
negative;"Regular problems when parking or picking-up the bikes: blocked slots on RED, full parking racks, etc.	"
positive;"Satisfied	"
negative;"it is difficult to use it since there are no stations in the stadium area	"
positive;"In July, maintenance on bicycles was really lacking: punctured wheels, electric bicycles unloaded, unscrewed seats, gearboxes that didn't work.	"
negative;"It would be important to be able to report the type of malfunction of a bike as most have some problems	"
positive;"In general I am satisfied. However, during the last month I happened several times not to find a place in the stalls in the evening hours, so I had to turn to find a place in other stalls.	"
positive;"need to put more stations to cover the city better and increase the service at night (at least on weekends). the rest is OK	"
positive;"more bike maintenance.	"
positive;"often I found the stalls without bicycles or not working	"
positive;"The new yellow / non-electric bikes you are replacing are a bit heavier and less comfortable ...	"
positive;"Please improve the gearbox maintenance, among all the components and the most sensitive and important after the brake. Unfortunately it is spent not usable so you find yourself doing all the way in one gear.	"
positive;"Spent in the morning, from Pagano station, I can't take a bike, it's not enough.	"
positive;"extension of cycle paths and n. of bike stations me	"
positive;"As a bad start, the stations should be upgraded, especially in the central hours. Customer service surprised me, very efficient	"
negative;"Few places to leave the bikes in the center, it would take an app to show the stations on the map and how to reach them	"
positive;"The cathedral station should be expanded, often at 9 am	"
positive;"Great	"
negative;"Always find the stations with bikes available to pick up and with the possibility to always leave them	"
negative;"difficult to find seats available at bikemi stations from the periphery to the center or vice versa	"
positive;"EXCELLENT SERVICE. SUGGEST YOU TO KEEP THE STATIONS OPEN ALL THE NIGHT, AS IT HAPPENS IN THE OTHER GREAT EUROPEAN CITIES	"
positive;"Yellow bikes too heavy. Juniors are too small for the middle range (9-13 years)	"
positive;"To improve bicycle maintenance and above all availability	"
negative;"Twice out of two I had problems leaving the bike and the intervention service intervened after days	"
negative;"missing rear-view mirror which also serves as a bicycle	"
positive;"I am very satisfied, the service is really efficient and comfortable. An added value to our city.	"
negative;"soo often broken bicycles, eg brakes, saddle, and are very heavy	"
positive;"in some locations bicycles are not always available	"
negative;"the bikes are heavy, I find it difficult to lift them to remove them and put them back in the rack. The last two times I took bikes, the brakes were either not working or very noisy. If there were safer streets in Milan with cycle paths I would use them. It is very dangerous to ride on the cobblestones and near the cars and the tram tracks.	"
positive;"More stations in the center	"
positive;"Sometimes the electrics don't work	"
positive;"Valid and effective service, I hope they last a long time and that people know how to maintain it without causing damage to bicycles when using them (I think that many think ""so much even if I break it is not mine"")	"
positive;"a great service, very convenient for commuters who choose to use the bicycle in the city. Unfortunately it is annoying to find the bicycles not working properly. Bicycles too heavy and unwieldy.	"
positive;"Many bikes do not work and I would prefer 24-hour service	"
positive;"My opinion is certainly positive, I appreciate the constantly expanding service, the only flaw in the maintenance situation ""DISASTROSA"" of bicycles !!!! thanks	"
positive;"It happened to me several times to give up the bikeMI because I was with friends without a subscription. It would be interesting to have the possibility of occasionally withdrawing more bikes together (perhaps with a discounted rate compared to the daily rental).	"
positive;"Great customer service, but I would have liked the service to be active 24/7. Very dissatisfied with the general state of the yellow bikes (often malfunctioning brakes and pedals)	"
positive;"Improve bike maintenance, especially check the filling / emptying of the racks in some critical points (for example off La Foppa)	"
positive;"the bikes are too heavy and the gearbox generally does not work	"
positive;"I consider the inclusion of bikes with child seats essential	"
positive;"Facilitate daily access	"
positive;"Better manage bicycle movements. At certain times the stations are completely devoid of vehicles or floods	"
positive;"it is a very good overall service, especially in a ""flat"" city and all in all contained as Milan. I would consider positive longer hours in the evening	"
positive;"It is essential to increase the number and distribution of parking spaces outside the 90-91 circle	"
negative;"Dear Sirs, I am enthusiastic about the use of bicycles in the city but: - assisted pedal bases have too many problems, sometimes loaded in a minimal way with the dangerousness of the roads, little culture for bike use. the bikes themselves are too heavy for detachment from the station - sometimes with problems of pedaling of tires flat of brakes etc ... it will make me cancel the subscription	"
positive;"Overall good service but the maintenance of the bicycles should be improved, some are poorly reduced. Another problem is that often there is no availability of stalls for redelivery in the most external stations, especially late at night. It would also be great to extend the duration of the 24 hour service.	"
negative;"I find the 3-speed gearbox is useless in a city like Milan (completely flat), I often find myself using yellow bikes with locked gears and I have a hard time pedaling. Propose bikes without gearboxes ?! thanks	"
positive;"valid, efficient and effective	"
negative;"The annual card has never arrived, despite numerous reminders. A great idea, but bad customer service. 6 out of 10 bikes I took were broken or malfunctioning. There are some stations where the bikes are never there, or vice versa, always full to be impossible to park, you have to go to another station far enough ... in short, there is to work	"
negative;"All right, some problems to leave the bike in very busy areas (eg Navigli), little coverage away from the center (eg Piazza Udine), I would add a feedback system to identify any bike with problems (I now know that informally tend to leave the saddle turned as a signal)	"
negative;"The bikes are very heavy, at the time of picking up and releasing the vehicle I encounter difficulties	"
positive;"Unfortunately the flaw in my case is related to the time of picking up the bikes. 7 o'clock in the morning, for those like me who go to the station to reach their place of work, it is too late. I think the time should start at six.	"
positive;"The bikes are not fantastic, but I understand ... I would increase the free ride to 60 minutes. I would charge more,	"
positive;"traditional bikes often don't work properly	"
negative;"The only flaw was to insert traditional bicycles but with the ""bodywork"" of electric bikes ... they are too heavy, very uncomfortable and too strenuous. Users always complain about those bikes.	"
positive;"Serve the suburbs more, where the metros are often distant and the means scarce or even non-existent	"
positive;"Expand capacity of crowded stations	"
positive;"Decrease the hourly price of the electric bike	"
positive;"Station in jerusalem square	"
negative;"I immediately adopted the service because I came from the Velib experience in Paris and from that I know the difference in not being able to choose the bike at the station and a very limited presence of stations	"
negative;"Too many accidents, too few tracks. Via the cars.	"
positive;"Many times, especially in the evening, it is quite difficult to find free stalls where you can leave your bike. In the evening relocation operations it would be advisable not to saturate the station but to leave free stalls. It would be very useful to be able to take and leave the bike 24 hours a day every day.	"
positive;"More stations in the Argonne area	"
negative;"a comment that I feel I can do, that often you find defective bikes	"
negative;"more maintenance, possibility to report to the stall a malfunction of the bike, more visible battery check, baskets also in the back, in case of bike malfunction and relative replacement also in other stalls to be able to do without waiting	"
positive;"IMPROVING THE MONITORING OF THE STATIONS, OFTEN I DO NOT FIND THE BIKE AT THE MORNING AT THE STATION OF SANT'AMBROGIO	"
negative;"missing fault reporting, suburban stations, improved availability of bikes / parking lots in critical stations, pumps at stations	"
negative;"Too often bicycles have problems, which you can only realize once on, so you are also forced to leave them at the nearest station. Among the most frequent problems: - brakes not working	"
negative;"With the years the yellow bikes are almost all broken. I took note for days of all the problems encountered and only 1 or 2 out of 10 work properly	"
positive;"Some discounts for the renewal of the subscription. The offers seem to me always and only for the new subscribers. In addition, a few more conventions for Bikemi subscribers who give discounts elsewhere.	"
positive;"Increase bike maintenance	"
positive;"make the yellow bikes easier by removing the gear and improving the maintenance	"
positive;"Free time must increase, 30 minutes for a city like Milan Nn makes sense	"
negative;"in the station of via Cassolo, sometimes the vehicle is missing	"
positive;"very satisfied	"
positive;"More maintenance on bicycles and if possible within 2/3 years a restyling to make them less heavy	"
negative;"the stalls are very uncomfortable. it becomes heavy type and raise bicycles especially the electric ones that I would like to take more often but they are heavy.	"
negative;"more bicycle maintenance is needed (wheels, gearbox, pedals) and there are often problems with the operation of the stations and the collection / return of bikes	"
negative;"Some stations are too isolated from the others, in case they are busy it is inconvenient to reach another free one	"
positive;"It would be useful if there were disposable objects (such as latex gloves) pet cover the seat and the end parts of the handlebar.	"
positive;"Prolong the hours at night	"
negative;"The main problem is leaving the bicycle. Sometimes it doesn't stick well and I happened to call the customer service that it has solved very well	"
negative;"Very often the yellow bicycles click (the chain) and it becomes very difficult to continue. Unfortunately we realize it too late when we have already started. Furthermore there are very few cycle paths, the scooters go on the cycle path and it becomes very dangerous, both to breathe the exhaust gases and for any accidents.	"
positive;"need to improve maintenance	"
positive;"In addition to what is specified in point 24, more maintenance on both bikes and stations (sometimes the bikes are not properly attached)	"
positive;"Further stations widening the radius of the city: for example over Loreto towards Sesto	"
positive;"Less heavy bikes	"
negative;"Too often there are problems returning the bike, or there are no stalls, or despite the correct signals, the station charges a few euros for ""non-return"". In some moments I even find myself charged for journeys never made, when in the meantime I have made others (therefore impossible, given that you cannot take two bikes at a time).	"
positive;"Very satisfied, if there were more cycle / connected and separated adl road it would be heaven	"
positive;"Add Stations along Viale Monza	"
positive;"it would be interesting to have advice of usual times where to place or deliver the bikes (eg avoid going to the center after 9 o'clock or not claiming a bike in the center after 10pm	"
positive;"Put a Bikemi station in Piazza Gambara	"
positive;"Please have more control over the gears and brakes	"
positive;"I'm quite satisfied	"
positive;"Very often yellow bicycles have flat tires or the brakes do not work.	"
positive;"I am very enthusiastic about the bikemi service, I come from a small provincial town and I have always been used to riding a bicycle even in winter with cold and rain. I would always like to use it even in Milan, too bad that it is really dangerous or complicated because there are no bike paths, paved roads / narrow streets and often you are forced to go on the sidewalk. In short, it seems that the city does everything possible to prevent you from using your bicycle, in the last few years (I have been living in Milan for 10 years) the situation has changed and certainly improved but there is still much to do. I would like Milan to become a day like Copenhagen because the size (it is a relatively small city) and the characteristics (all plain) would easily allow its citizens to move only by bike. Good luck for future projects and thanks for what has been done to date.	"
negative;"for me there is only one problem, it is that unfortunately there are often no electric bikes because they are all unloaded	"
positive;"overall positive even if the bikes are often damaged, but noticing after having taken them, it is necessary to wait 5 minutes before taking another one.	"
positive;"Excellent means	"
positive;"I would appreciate the possibility of replacing the card with the app.	"
positive;"The bikes are really too heavy and not very agile to use, the gearbox often doesn't work	"
positive;"This is a good service, to which I would add more bike lanes, and more stations, not even more decentralized areas.	"
negative;"Overall, I am satisfied with the limits stated above regarding the frequent lack of number of stalls (my reference station and that of via morgagni). In addition, the tire pressure and the pedal function should be checked more frequently	"
positive;"Very good	"
positive;"Computer services are indecent. The online portal does not meet the minimum IT security standards and the app does not allow you to use the map easily.	"
positive;"It would take more and careful maintenance of the bicycles. Check both the availability and capacity of the stations from Remote	"
positive;"Provide for larger car parks so as not to find them already full at peak times	"
positive;"Improve bike maintenance and bicinper station quantities (not to find or find the complete station and never know where to store it)	"
positive;"You need more racks in the center	"
negative;"Premise: I always use red bicycles ... sometimes the yellow ones for short journeys when the red ones are not available. The things that are not right are: 1) non-intelligent stalls: red bikes do not recharge on the stall and the stall is not able to understand if a bike is loaded or not. Often he does not pick up bikes with 4 charge LEDs and assigns bikes with 1 or 2 charge LEDs which are exhausted after a few rides. 2) there are few red bikes	"
positive;"The yellow bikes have heavy steering / handlebars, on some occasions they are not very ""balanced""	"
positive;"The service is excellent, it should improve the maintenance of yellow bicycles, they often have difficulty pedaling and braking. However, the BikeMi service is really useful and environmentally friendly	"
negative;"Plan for bikes with a lower saddle for low people	"
positive;"good service can be improved	"
positive;"It's a great service, it will be even better when the suburban stations increase. I use it little because I use the bike only where there are bicycle lanes, normal roads is too risky to go by bike. It would be very useful to be able to have bikes with seats to accompany children to school and / or stations near the nursery / primary schools to save time on the way between school and work.	"
negative;"Missing station in gambara	"
positive;"improve maintenance / increase stations	"
positive;"Lately it often happens that you do not find bicycles or find full stalls on delivery, perhaps due to work all over Milan.	"
negative;"Many yellow bikes have gearboxes that don't work well	"
positive;"As in many European cities, it is important and useful that there is such a service in Milan. I pay the subscription to support it, even if I use it very little, preferring my personal bike. As said it is absurd that the service is not usable at night, while it is average in other cities. I would also like it to finally arrive in my area (Viale Campania)!	"
negative;"OFTEN THE STATIONS HAVE NO FREE PLACES TO LEAVE THE BIKE	"
positive;"The stations are often too full and I can't leave the bike and 2 hours is too little	"
positive;"Yellow bikes begin to record maintenance needs. A few red bikes ... I often can't find them	"
positive;"I greatly appreciate BikeMi. It would be nice to have lighter bicycles	"
negative;"the most unpleasant unexpected is when the pedals do not rotate, it often happens	"
positive;"improve brake and chain and gearbox maintenance.	"
positive;"service starts (7.00 am) too late	"
negative;"For some months now, the service has deteriorated, stalls often only with broken bikes, so no possibility of picking up, badly maintained and unsafe bikes	"
positive;"A simpler application to find out if there are parking spaces to store the bike	"
positive;"It would be advisable to improve bike maintenance even if this would lead to an increase in the cost of the pass	"
positive;"Improve regular and routine maintenance	"
positive;"Balance stations more frequently during peak hours	"
positive;"Improvement of the app is absolutely necessary	"
negative;"too heavy. lack of cycle paths. tropeo pav√® in the center	"
positive;"I am enthusiastic about the service. It is efficient and does not pollute	"
positive;"Often the stations are without bicycles or full and the one in use cannot be stored	"
positive;"Twice I couldn't use the electric bike	"
positive;"Maintenance sometimes leaves something to be desired	"
positive;"Good service, unfortunately bikes don't work well, perhaps because of a low number of user reports. It is necessary to find ways to encourage reporting. Furthermore, in particular periods of the year and in certain areas of the city, the stations are always occupied or never found available	"
positive;"Electric bikes are too often not available	"
positive;"I would make the service available 24 hours a day	"
positive;"thyme but the bikes are too heavy	"
positive;"Good for starting to update the yellow bikes. It would be good if everyone recycled them like this.	"
positive;"Enthusiastic! Great service .. congratulations!	"
positive;"MOVE THE SERVICE TO THE PERIPHERAL AREAS NEAR SUPERMARKETS	"
positive;"I kindly ask you to make the stall n. 151 Balilla - Tibaldi. Sometimes it is uninhabitable and there are few bicycles available or they are generally few or poorly functioning (eg deflated wheels, poorly functioning brakes, gearshift changes).	"
negative;"The changes must be replaced 7 times out of 10 are broken or malfunctioning then in the station of caneva or in cenisio the stalls are often empty	"
negative;"unfortunately, bicycles are often defective	"
negative;"inadequate paving outside the cycle paths	"
positive;"repair the bikes, especially the yellow ones, and increase the number of parking spaces in areas where there is a greater number of bikemi use. reduce the weight of bicycles if possible. I get on very well with this service and with my suggested suggestions it would be great.	"
negative;"Very convenient and efficient service, but more maintenance is needed on the bicycles, especially the yellow ones, and more attention on some stations that too often, at peak times, I find completely empty.	"
positive;"Treat the availability of the stalls more precisely and make sure that the bikes are always working. The overall judgment of the service is good	"
negative;"electric bikes almost never go and the displacement policy is terrible when they are needed there is no need for more solicitude and not bikes only where there are municipal offices ... they never fail	"
negative;"Mode to report broken bikes and deactivate them immediately from the rack	"
negative;"Experience no doubt positive some bikes are to be fixed	"
positive;"More maintenance, more efficiency in the management of the redelivery.	"
positive;"They are satisfied with the service, but very often the restitution does not work in the best way and I lose a lot of time checking again and again	"
negative;"sometimes when you have to leave the bike the stations are full or it also happens that when you have to take them the stations are empty	"
positive;"Fine initiative, capillarity already good ... it would be great if it were thickened.	"
positive;"too often the stations are full during working hours and it is necessary to park far away losing the benefit of proximity	"
positive;"We should find a more effective method to understand the station with free seats and with bikes available (on the site it is not very user friendly). Maybe add booking possibilities	"
negative;"you could do without bikes because many don't work very well, skip the gear and this is really uncomfortable when you ride	"
positive;"they are very heavy to remove and put away from the station. The helmet supplied would be fantastic.	"
positive;"great service, more maintenance would be needed (bikes are often run-down and red ones not working), increase the number of parking spaces per car (often full), increase the number of red bikes	"
negative;"Great. Occasionally the ebikes are dead and it is a drama to lead them because they are too heavy	"
negative;"Beautiful service, too bad the cycle paths are missing	"
positive;"The maintenance of the bikes has deteriorated or rather the bikes are in perfect condition a few times. The defect that often is the exchange that does not work or the ramshackle pedals	"
positive;"lighter bikes	"
positive;"in the morning impossible to find to go to work	"
positive;"Very satisfied with the service in general, I would suggest more frequent revisions to vehicles, in particular brakes and cardan transmission (it often happens that you ""give in"" to pedaling). The overhaul system could be optimized giving the possibility to report at the redelivery if the vehicle shows malfunctions.	"
positive;"I am an enthusiastic supporter of BikeMi. Too often though, the return system does not work properly and indicates that the bike is still in use when it is not. They are perhaps too heavy bikes.	"
positive;"expand the areas served (specifically Lorenteggio)	"
positive;"there are few electric bikes - cover stations and peripheral areas	"
positive;"I think it's a useful and pleasant service, indispensable for a city like Milan. for me it is a sustainable solution in every sense, especially from an economic point of view	"
positive;"Install a station in via verde (they did the cycle)	"
negative;"As an assiduous user of BikeMi with an annual subscription that has already been renewed for 2 years, I consider the service unsatisfactory due to the stalls always full / in the evening the same stalls are always empty.	"
positive;"It is a pride of Milan ... now we must win the challenge of empowerment! Thanks!!	"
negative;"more bicycle maintenance would be required. in recent times numerous bikes are damaged or malfunctioning	"
positive;"Bikes are heavy to hook. It would be better to use another system	"
negative;"More attention to the stations, often they are all full and this makes it impossible to leave the bike, especially in the evening and in my area that is Porta Roma / via Friuli	"
positive;"SOMETIMES DIFFICULT TO FIND STATIONS WITH THE FREE SPACE TO LEAVE THE BIKE	"
positive;"improve stall management (when full or empty)	"
positive;"I find the initiative useful and avant-garde, but at the very moment I pick up a bike and it is not efficient I find it inconceivable not to be able to hang it up and take another one more efficient.	"
positive;"Fantastic service. At peak times in the center too often it is difficult to leave or take bikes	"
positive;"They are too heavy to ride	"
positive;"ADD STATIONS TO PERIPHERAL DISTRICTS	"
negative;"The service should be available on all 24 hours, because those who work on shifts or leave home very early cannot use it. Moreover it is not very present beyond the external bypass (90/91)	"
negative;"Frequent technical problems in the redelivery	"
positive;"Improve the app. Make the bicycle change faster if the first bike is damaged	"
positive;"better bike rotation is required. often I was ""on foot"" without a bike or without the possibility of returning it due to too full or too empty stations.	"
negative;"it's not good that the use is reduced to 2 hours, yet there are a lot of uncovered places that have no stations to leave the bike. I do not understand why one can no longer take the bike, it should be a service in addition to the hours of the metro / bus.	"
positive;"More comfortable seats, more stations	"
negative;"Often there are bicycles with punctured or damaged wheels and when it is assigned it cannot be changed - except waiting for the time to take another bike.	"
positive;"I have always found myself very well, but for some months I have had many problems finding free stalls in the central area	"
negative;"as already mentioned the stations are all too central, made for Milanese nobles who move without difficulty from corso italia to viale montenero. for commuters who come to rogoredo type you are forced to take the metro. I personally rogoredo viale montenero where I work would prefer to take the bike to rogoredo than to take line 3.	"
positive;"move bicycles better during peak periods leaving / entering from work and increasing stalls at junctions with high public transport	"
negative;"YELLOW BIKE IS OFTEN UNUSABLE BECAUSE IT IS DEFECTIVE	"
positive;"improve with more points	"
positive;"IMPROVING STALL EFFICIENCY	"
negative;"well, but problem in some stations of the center of overcrowding, there is no place	"
positive;"continue to install new stations in peripheral residential areas	"
positive;"Electric bikes almost never work	"
positive;"I would like the presence of stations to be extended even beyond the Lambrate station, for example in the Casoretto or Udine area	"
positive;"really satisfied with this service	"
negative;"Main problem I think is the maintenance of traditional bikes, often you are forced to change bikes several times before finding a functioning one	"
positive;"I feel good but without a credit card you can't even buy a day card, it doesn't seem right because students like me often only have a prepaid card	"
positive;"I don't have any suggestions at the moment. the comment, thank you for the excellent service provided.	"
positive;"I would like it if the number of red ebikes increased considerably	"
positive;"need more maintenance, stations in the center with too many bikes	"
